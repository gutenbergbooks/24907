<h1 style="padding-top: 3em;">THE LADY AND THE PIRATE</h1>



<h2 style="padding-top: 3em;">CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I AM A CAITIFF</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS sitting at one of my favorite spots engaged
in looking through my fly-book for some
lure that might, perhaps, mend my luck in the
afternoon&rsquo;s fishing. At least, I had within the
moment been so engaged; although the truth is that
the evening was so exceptionally fine, and the spot
always so extraordinarily attractive to me&mdash;this
particular angle of the stream, where the tall
birches stand, being to my mind the most beautiful
bit on my whole estate&mdash;that I had forgotten
all about angling and was sitting with rod laid
by upon the bank, the fly-book scarce noted in
my hand. Moreover, a peculiarly fine specimen
of Anopheles, (as I took it to be) was at that
very moment hovering over my hand, and I was
anxious to confirm my judgment as well as to
enlarge my collection of mosquitoes. I had my
other hand in a pocket feeling for the little phial
in which I purposed to enclose Anopheles, if I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
could coax him to alight. Indeed, I say, I was
at that very moment as happy as a man need
be; or, at least, as happy as I ever expected to be.
Imagine my surprise, therefore, at that moment
to hear a voice, apparently intended for me, exclaim,
&ldquo;Halt! Caitiff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked up, more annoyed than displeased or
startled. It is not often one sees so fine a specimen
of Anopheles; and one could have sworn
that, but for my slight involuntary movement
of the hand, he must have settled; after which&mdash;<i>crede
experto!</i>&mdash;he would have been the same
as in my phial, and doomed to the chloroform
within the next hour. Besides, no matter who
one may be or how engaged, it is not wholly
seemly to be accosted as a caitiff, when one is on
one&rsquo;s own land, offending no man on earth, owing
no debt and paying no tribute, feudal, commercial,
military or personal, to any man on earth.</p>

<p>The situation seemed to me singular. Had the
time been some centuries earlier, the place somewhere
in the old world, such speech might have
had better fitting. But the time was less than
a year ago, the place was in America. I was on
my own lands, in this one of our middle states.
This was my own river; or at least, I owned the
broad acres on both sides of it for some miles.
And I was a man of no slinking habit, no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
repulsive mien, of that I was assured, but a successful
American of means; lately a professional man
and now a man of leisure, and not so far past
thirty years of age. My fly-rod was the best
that money can buy, and the pages of the adjacent
book were handsomely stocked by the best makers
of this country and each of the three divisions
of Great Britain; in each of which&mdash;as well as in
Norway, Germany, or for the matter of that,
India, New Zealand, Alaska, Japan or other lands&mdash;I
had more than once wet a line. My garb
was not of leather jerkin, my buskins not of
thonged straw, but on the contrary I was turned
out in good tweeds, well cut by my London tailor.
To be called offhand, and with no more reason
than there was provocation, a &ldquo;caitiff,&rdquo; even by a
voice somewhat treble and a trifle trembling, left
me every reason in the world to be surprised, annoyed
and grieved. For now Anopheles had
flown away; and had I not been thus startled,
I should certainly have had him. Yet more, no
fish would rise in that pool the rest of that evening,
for no trout in my little stream thereabout
ever had seen a boat or been frightened by the
plash of an oar since the time, three years back,
when I had bought the place.</p>

<p>I looked up. Just at the bend, arrested now by
hand anchorage to the overhanging alders, lay
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
a small boat, occupied by two boys, neither of
more than fourteen years, the younger seemingly
not more than twelve. It was the latter who was
clinging with one hand to the drooping bushes.
His companion, apparently the leader in their
present enterprise, was half crouching in the bow
of the boat and he, evidently, was the one who
had accosted me.</p>

<p>A second glance gave me even more surprise,
for it showed that the boat, though not precisely
long, low and rakish of build, evidently was of
piratical intent. At least she was piratical in
decoration. On each side of her bow there was
painted&mdash;and the evening sun, shining through
my larches, showed the paint still fresh&mdash;in more
or less accurate design in black, the emblem of
a skull and cross-bones. Above her, supported
by a short staff, perhaps cut from my own willows,
flew a black flag, and whatever may have
been her stern-chaser equipment, her broadside
batteries, or her deck carronades&mdash;none of which
I could well make out, as her hull lay half concealed
among the alders&mdash;her bow-chaser was certainly
in commission and manned for action. The
pirate captain, himself, was at the lanyard; and
I perceived that he now rested an extraordinarily
large six-shooter in the fork of a short staff, which
was fixed in the bow. Along this, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
three-cornered gray eye, he now sighted at the lower
button of my waistcoat, and in a fashion
that gave me goose-flesh underneath the button,
in spite of all my mingled emotions. Had I not
&ldquo;halted,&rdquo; as ordered, to the extent of sitting on
quietly as I was, he no doubt would have pulled
the lanyard, with consequences such as I do not
care to contemplate, and mayhap to the effect that
this somewhat singular story would never have been
written.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt, Sirrah!&rdquo; began the pirate leader again,
&ldquo;or I will blow you out of the water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat for a moment regarding him, my chin
in my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I at last; &ldquo;I already am out of the
water, my friend. But, prithee, have a care of
yonder lanyard, else, gadzooks! you may belike
blow me off the bank and into the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech of mine seemed as much to disconcert
the pirate chieftain as had his me. He
stood erect, shifting his Long Tom, to the great
ease of my waistcoat button.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you heave to, and put off a small boat
for a parley?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I HOLD A PARLEY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE two pirates turned to each other for consultation,
irresolute, but evidently impressed
by the fact that their prize did not purpose to
hoist sail and make a run for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho! mates?&rdquo; demanded the captain, in
as gruff a voice as he could compass: &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve
heard his speech, and he has struck his flag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the villain plays us false,&rdquo; rejoined
the &ldquo;mates&rdquo; or rather, the mate, in a voice so
high or quavering that for a moment it was difficult
for me to repress a smile; although these
three years past I rarely had smiled at all.</p>

<p>The captain turned to one side, so that now I
could see both him and his crew. The leader was
as fine a specimen of boy as you could have asked,
sturdy of bare legs, brown of face, red of hair,
ragged and tumbled of garb. His crew was active
though slightly less robust, a fair-haired, light-skinned
chap, blue-eyed, and somewhat better clad
than his companion. There was something winning
about his face. At a glance I knew his soul.
He was a dreamer, an idealist, an artist, in the
bud. My heart leaped out to him instinctively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
in a great impulse of sympathy and understanding.
Indeed, suddenly, I felt the blood tingle through
my hair. I looked upon life as I had not these
three years. The imagination of Youth, the
glamour of Adventure, lay here before me; things
I cruelly had missed these last few years, it
seemed to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, now, shipmates?&rdquo; I remarked mildly.
&ldquo;Wouldst doubt the faith of one who himself
hath flown the Jolly Rover? Cease your fears
and come aboard&mdash;that is to say, come ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git out, Jimmy,&rdquo; I heard the captain say in
a low voice, after a moment of indecision. &ldquo;Keep
him covered till I tie her up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy, the fair-haired pirate, hauled in on the
alders and flung a grappling iron aboard my bank,
which presently he ascended. As he stood free
from the screening fringe of bushes, I saw that
he was slender, and not very tall, one not wholly
suited by nature to his stern calling. His once
white jacket now was soiled, and one leg of his
knickers was loose, from his scramble up the
bank. He was belted beyond all earl-like need; wore
indeed two belts, which supported two long hunting
knives and a Malay kris, such as we now get
from the Philippines; as well as a revolver large
beyond all proportion to his own size. A second
revolver of like dimensions now trembled in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
hand, and even though its direction toward me
was no more than general, I resumed the goose-flesh
underneath my waistcoat, for no man could
tell what might happen. In none of my works
with dangerous big game have I felt a similar
uneasiness; no, nor even in the little affair in
China where the Boxers held us up, did I ever
really consider the issue more in doubt. It pleased
me, however, to make no movement of offense
or defense; and luckily the revolver was not discharged.</p>

<p>When the two had topped the bank, and had
approached me&mdash;taking cover behind trees in a
way which made me suspect Boy Scout training,
mingled with bandit literature&mdash;to a point where
we could see each other&rsquo;s features plainly, I moved
over to one side of my bank, and motioned them
to approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come alongside, brothers,&rdquo; said I, pushing my
fly-rod to one side; &ldquo;make fast and come aboard.
And tell me, what cheer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They drew up to me, stern of mien, bold of
bearing, dauntless of purpose. At least, so I was
convinced, each wished and imagined himself to
seem; and since they wished so to be seen thus,
seized by some sudden whim, I resolved to see
them. How I envied them! Theirs all the
splendor of youth, of daring, of adventure, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
romance; things gone by from me, or for the
most part, never known.</p>

<p>Frowning sternly, they seated themselves reluctantly
on the grassy bank beside me, and gazed
out in the dignity of an imagined manhood across
my river, which now was lighted bravely by the
retiring sun. Had I not felt with them, longed
with them, they could never so splendidly have
maintained their pretense. But between us, there
in the evening on my stream with only the birds
and the sun to see, it was not pretense. Upon the
contrary, all cloaks were off, all masks removed,
and we were face to face in the strong light of
reality. As clearly as though I always had known
them, I saw into the hearts of these; and what I
saw made my own heart ache and yearn for something
it had ever missed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheer, comrades?&rdquo; I repeated at length.
&ldquo;Whither away, and upon what errand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now a strange thing happened, which I do not
explain, for that I can not. In plain fact, these
two were obviously runaway boys, not the first,
nor perhaps the last of runaway boys; and I was
a man of means, a retired man, supposedly somewhat
of a hermit, although really nothing of the
sort; lately a lawyer, hard-headed and disillusioned,
always a man of calm reason, as I prided myself;
subject to no fancies, a student and a lover of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
science, a mocker at all superstition and all weak-mindedness.
(Pardon me, that I must say all these
things of myself.) Yet, let me be believed who
say it, some spell, whether of this presence of
Youth, whether of the evening and the sun, or
whether of the inner and struggling soul of Man,
so fell upon us all then and there, that we were
not man and boys, but bold adventurers, all three
of like kidney! This was not a modern land that
lay about us. Yonder was not the copse beyond
the birches, where my woodcock sometimes found
cover. This was not my trout-stream. Those
yonder were not my elms and larches moving
in the evening air. No, before us lay the
picture of the rolling deep, its long green swells
breaking high in white spindrift. The keen wind
of other days sounded in our ears, and yonder
pressed the galleons of Spain! Youth, Youth and
Adventure, were ours.</p>

<p>We smiled not at all, therefore, as, with some
thoughtful effort, it is true, we held to fitting
manner of speech. &ldquo;We seek for treasure,&rdquo; piped
the thin voice of him I had heard called Jimmy.
&ldquo;Let none dare lift hand against us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whither away, my hearties?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spang! to the Spanish Main.&rdquo; This also from
the blue-eyed boy; who, now, with some difficulty,
managed to let down the hammer of his six-shooter
without damage to himself or others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know but youse would try to stop
us,&rdquo; exclaimed the red-haired leader. &ldquo;We come
around the bend and seen you settin&rsquo; there; an&rsquo;
we was resolved&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sell our lives dearly!&rdquo; supplemented Jimmy.
&ldquo;He who would seek to stop us does so at his
peril.&rdquo; And Jimmy made so fell a movement toward
his side-arms that I hastened to restrain him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you are quite right, my hearties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, gee!&rdquo; ventured the red-haired pirate,
&ldquo;what was you thinkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask me to tell truth, good Sire,&rdquo; I made
reply, &ldquo;and I shall do no less. At the very moment
you trained your bow-chaser on me, I was thinking
of two things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak on, caitiff!&rdquo; demanded Jimmy fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, call me not so, good Sir,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;for
such, in good-sooth, I am not, but honest faithful
man. Ye have but now asked what I pondered,
and I fain would speak truth, an&rsquo; it please ye, my
hearties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he givin&rsquo; us, Jimmy?&rdquo; whispered the
pirate captain dubiously, aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak on!&rdquo; again commanded he of the blue
eyes. &ldquo;But your life blood dyes the deck if you
seek to deceive Jean Lafitte, or Henry L&rsquo;Olonnois!&rdquo;</p>

<p>(So then, thought I, at last I knew their names.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
In reply I reached to my belt and drew out
quickly&mdash;so quickly that they both flinched away&mdash;the
long handled knife which, usually, I carried
with me for cutting down alders or other
growth which sometimes entangled my flies as I
fished along the stream. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I swear
the pirates&rsquo; oath. On the point of my blade,&rdquo; and
I touched it with my right forefinger, &ldquo;I swear
that I pondered on two things when you surprised
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name them!&rdquo; demanded Jimmy L&rsquo;Olonnois
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, then,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I was wondering
what I could use as a cork to my phial, when once
I had yonder Anopheles in it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; demanded Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anopheles? A friend of mine,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;a
mosquito, in short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, he&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo; ejaculated Jean Lafitte
uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say on, caitiff!&rdquo; commanded L&rsquo;Olonnois, ignoring
him; &ldquo;what else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second place,&rdquo; said I&mdash;and again I placed
my right forefinger on the point of my blade, &ldquo;I
was thinking of Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she your little girl,&rdquo; hesitatingly inquired
Jimmy L&rsquo;Olonnois, for the instant forgetting his
part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I sadly, &ldquo;she is not my little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regarding the whereabouts of either Anopheles
or Helena, at this moment,&rdquo; said I still sadly, &ldquo;I
am indeed all at sea, as any good pirate should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to jest, but fared ill at it. I felt my face
flush at hearing her name spoken aloud. And
sadly true was it that, on that afternoon and many
another, I had found myself, time and again,
adream with Helena&rsquo;s face before me. I saw it
now&mdash;a face I had not seen these three years, since
the time when first I had come hither with the purpose
of forgetting.</p>

<p>Jimmy was back in his part again, and doing
nobly. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So, fellow, pondering on
a fair one, didst not hear the approach of our good
ship, the <i>Sea Rover</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In good sooth, I did not,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;and as
for these other matters, I swear on my blade&rsquo;s
point I have spoken the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our conversation languished for the moment.
Illusion lay in the balance. The old melancholy
impended above me ominously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I AM A CAPTIVE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;W</span>HAT ho! Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; said I at length,
rousing myself from the old habit of
reverie, of which I had chiefest dread; &ldquo;and you,
Henri L&rsquo;Olonnois, scourges of the main, both of
you, listen! I have a plan to put before you, my
hearties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say on, Sirrah!&rdquo; rejoined the younger pirate,
so promptly and so gravely that again I had much
to do to refrain from sudden mirth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why then, look ye,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;The sun
is sinking beneath the wave, and the good ship
rides steady at her anchor. Meantime men must
eat! and yonder castle amid the forest offers booty.
What say ye if we pass within the wood, and
see what we may find of worth to souls bold as
ours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well!&rdquo; answered L&rsquo;Olonnois; and I could
see assent in Lafitte&rsquo;s eyes. In truth I could discover
no great preparations for a long voyage in
the open hold of the <i>Sea Rover</i>, and doubted not
that both captain and crew by this time were
hungry. Odd crumbs of crackers and an empty
sardine can might be all very well at the edge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
the village of Pausaukee (I judged they could
have come no greater distance, some twelve or
fifteen miles); but they do not serve for so long
a journey as lies between Pausaukee and the
Spanish Main.</p>

<p>They rose as I did, and we passed beyond the
clump of tall birches, along the edge of my mowing
meadow, and through the gate which closes
my woodland path&mdash;to me the loveliest of all wood-trails,
so gentle and so silent is it always, and so
fringed, seasonably, with ferns and flowers. Thus,
presently, we saw the blue smoke rising above my
lodge, betokening to me that my Japanese factotum,
Hiroshimi, now had my dinner under way.</p>

<p>To me, it was my customary abode, my home
these three years; but they beside me saw not
the rambling expanse of my leisurely log mansion.
They noted not the overhanging gables, the
lattices of native wood. To them, yonder lay a
castle in a foreign land. Here was moat and wall,
then a portcullis, and gratings warded these narrow
portals against fire of musketoon. My pet
swallows&rsquo; nest, demure above my door, to them
offered the aspect of a culverin&rsquo;s mouth; and, as
now, I made my customary approach-call, by
which I heralded my return from any excursion
on the stream of an evening, I could swear these
invaders looked for naught less than a swarm of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
archers springing to the walls, and the hoarse answer
of my men-at-arms back of each guarded
portal. Such is the power of youthful dreaming,
such the residuary heritage of days of high emprise,
when life was full of blood and wine and
love, and savored not so wholly of dull commonplace!</p>

<p>But indeed, (or so I presume; for at the moment
my own imagination swept on with theirs) none
manned the walls or rattled the chains of gate
and bridge. The saffron Hiroshimi opened the
screen door before us, showing no surprise or
interest in my strange companions. Thus we made
easy conquest of our castle. As we entered, there
lay before us, lighted softly by the subdued twilight
which filtered through the surrounding grove,
the interior of that home which in three years I
had learned much to love, lonely as it was. Here
I now dwelt most of the time, leaving behind me,
as though shut off by a closed door, the busy
scenes of an active and successful life. (I presume
I may fairly speak thus of myself, since there
is no one else to speak.)</p>

<p>My pirate companions, suddenly grown shy,
stood silent for a moment, for the time rather
at a loss to carry on the play which had been
easier in the open. I heard Jimmy draw a long
breath. He was first to remove his hat. But his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
companion was quicker to regain his poise, although
for a moment he forgot his pirate speech.
&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I doubt if any praise I ever heard in my life
pleased me more than this frank comment; no,
not even the kind word and hand-clasp of old
Judge Henderson, what time I won my first cause
at law. For this that lay about me was what I
had chosen for my life to-day. I had preferred
this to the career into which my father&rsquo;s restless
ambition had plunged me almost as soon as I had
emerged from my college and my law-school&mdash;a
career which my own restless ambition had found
sufficient until that final break with Helena Emory,
which occurred soon after the time when my
father died; when the news went out that I, his
heir, was left with but a shrunken fortune, and
with many debts to pay; news which I, myself,
had promulgated for reasons of my own. After
that, called foolish by all my friends, lamented by
members of my family, forgotten, as I fancy, by
most who knew me, I had retired to this lodge
in the wilderness. Here, grown suddenly resentful
of a life hitherto wasted in money-getting
alone, I had resolved to spend the remainder of
my days, as beseemed a student and a philosopher.
Having read Weininger and other philosophers, I
was convinced that woman was the lowest and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
most unworthy thing in the scale of created
things, a thing quite beneath the attention of a
thinking man.</p>

<p>I have said that I was scarce beyond thirty
years of age. Even so, I found myself already
old; and like any true philosopher, I resolved to
make myself young. As hitherto I had had no
boyhood, I determined to achieve a boyhood for
myself. Studying myself, I discovered that I had
rarely smiled; so I resolved to find somewhat to
make me smile. The great realm of knowledge,
widest and sweetest of all empires for a man, lay
before me alluringly when I entered upon my business
career; and so interested was I in my business
and my books that only by chance had I
met the woman who drove me out of both. A
boy I had never been; nay, nor even a youth. I
had always been old. True, like others of my
station, I had owned my auto cars, my matched
teams&mdash;owned them now, indeed&mdash;but I had never
owned a dog. So, when I came hither with ample
leisure, perhaps my chief ambition was a deliberate
purpose to encompass my deferred boyhood.
Thus I had built this house of logs which now&mdash;with
a surprised and gratifying throb of my heart
I learned it&mdash;appealed to the souls of real boys.
It was the castle where I dreamed; and now it
was the palace of their dreams also. I felt, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
least, that I had succeeded. My heart throbbed
in a new way, very foolish, yet for some reason
suddenly enjoyable.</p>

<p>My house was all of logs and had no decorations
of paint or tapestry within. Its only arras
was of the skins of wild beasts&mdash;of the African
lion and leopard, the zebra, many antelopes.
The walls were hung with mounted heads&mdash;those
of the moose, the elk, the bighorn, most of the
main trophies of my own land and to these,
through my foreign hunting, I had added heads
of all the great trophies of Africa and Asia as
well. A splendid pair of elephant tusks stood in
a corner. A fine head of the sheep of Tibet,
<i>ovus poli</i>&mdash;and I prize none of my trophies more,
unless it be the fine robe of the Chinese mountain
tiger&mdash;looked full front at us from above the fireplace.
My rod racks, and those which supported my
guns and rifles, were here and there about the room.
The whole gave a jaunty atmosphere to my home.
I had gone soberly about the business of sport;
and in these days, that can be practised most successfully
by a man with much leisure and unstinted
means.</p>

<p>My books lay about everywhere, also, books
which perhaps would not have appealed to all.
My copies of the Vedas, many works on the
Buddhist faith, and translations from Confucius,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
lay side by side with that Bible which we Christians
have almost forgot. Here, too, stood my desk
with its cases of preserved mosquitoes&mdash;for this
year I was studying mosquitoes as an amusement.
I had collected all the mosquito literature of the
world, and my books, in French, German and
English, lay near my great microscope. I had
passed many happy hours here in the oblivion of
mental concentration, always a delight with me,
now grown almost a necessity if I were to escape
the worst of all habits, that of introspection and
self-pity.</p>

<p>My piano and my violins also were in full sight;
for the world of music, as well as the world of
sport and youth, I was deliberately opening for
myself, also in exchange for that closed world of
affairs which I had abandoned. Indeed, all manners
of the impedimenta of a well-to-do Japanese-cared-for
bachelor were in evidence. To me, each object
was familiar and was cherished. I had never felt
need to apologize to any gentleman for my
quarters or their contents&mdash;or to any woman, for
no woman had ever seen my home. I may admit
that, contrary to the belief of some, I was a
rich man, far richer that I had need or care to
be; and since it was not due to my own ability
altogether nor in response to any real ambition of
my own, I know I will be pardoned for simply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
stating the truth. My one great ambition in life
was to forget; but if that might be best obtained
in sport, in study, or amid the gentle evidences
of good living, so much the better. Many
men had called my father, stern and masterful
man that he was, a robber, a thief, a pirate&mdash;in
great part, I suspect, in envy that they themselves
had not attained a like stature in similar achievement.
But no one had ever called his son a pirate&mdash;until
now! It made me oddly happy.</p>

<p>I ought to have been happy here all these years,
able to do precisely what I liked; but sometimes
I felt myself strangely alone in the world. I was
always silent and apparently cold&mdash;though really,
let me whisper&mdash;only shy. Sometimes, even here,
I found myself a trifle sad. It is difficult to be a
boy when one starts at thirty; especially difficult if
one has always been rather old and staid.</p>

<p>I tell all these things to explain that keen pleasure,
that swift exultation, that rush of the blood
to my cheeks, which I felt when I saw that my
house and my way of life met the approval of
real boys. Pirates, too!</p>

<p>Swift, therefore, fell once more the magic curtain
of romance. I heard a strange voice, my own
voice, saying: &ldquo;Enter then, my bold mates, and
let us explore this castle which we have conquered.&rdquo;
Yes, illusion floated in through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
windows on the pale light of the evening. This
was a castle we had taken; and the detail that I
chanced to own it was neither here nor there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prisoner,&rdquo; began L&rsquo;Olonnois sternly&mdash;he was
usually spokesman, if not always leader&mdash;&ldquo;Prisoner,
your life is spared for the time. Lead on!
Attempt to play us false, and your blood shall be
spilled upon the deck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be so,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And if I do not
give you the best meal you have had to-day, then
indeed let my life&rsquo;s blood stain the deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, I nodded to Hiroshimi to serve the
dinner.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I AM A PIRATE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH my own hands I have trained that
prize, Hiroshimi, to cook and to serve; but
only Providence could give Hiroshimi his super-humanly
disinterested calm. He fitted perfectly into
the picture of our dream. &rsquo;Twas no ordinary
log house in which we sat, indeed no house at
all. Beneath us rose and fell a stanch vessel,
responsive to the long lift of the southern seas.
It was not a rustle of the leaves we heard through
the open windows, but the low ripple of waves
along our strakes came to our ears through the
open ports. Hiroshimi did not depart to the
kitchen; but high aloft our lookout swept the
sea for sail that might offer us a prize.</p>

<p>If any say that this manner of illusion may
not exist between two boys and a man, I answer
that we did not thus classify it. By the new
pleasure in my soul, by the new blood in my
cheek, I swear we were three boys together,
and all in quest of adventure.</p>

<p>True, at times our speech smacked less of
nautical and piratical phrase, at times, indeed,
halted. It is difficult for a twelve-year-old pirate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
exceeding hungry, to ask for a third helping of
grilled chicken in a voice at once stern and ingratiating.
Moreover, it is difficult for a discreet
and law-abiding citizen, with a full sense of duty,
deliberately to aid and abet two youthful runaways.
But whenever illusion wavered, L&rsquo;Olonnois
saved the day by resuming his stern scowl, even
above a chicken-bone. His facility in rolling
speech I discovered to be, in part, attributable to
a volume which I saw protruding from his pocket.
At my request he passed it to me, and I saw its
title; <i>The Pirate&rsquo;s Own Book</i>. I knew it well.
Indeed, I now arose, and passing to my bookshelves,
drew down a duplicate copy of that rare
volume, recounting the deeds of the old buccaneers.
The eyes of L&rsquo;Olonnois widened as I laid
the two side by side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it, too!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That explains it,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explains what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how you&mdash;why now&mdash;how you could be
a pirate, too, just as natural as us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read it many a time,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you never a pirate?&rdquo; asked Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;although many have
said my father was. He was very rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can talk just like us,&rdquo; said Jean
Lafitte admiringly, &ldquo;even if you have lost all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said I exultingly. &ldquo;Why not? I
think as you do. As much as you I am disgusted
with the dulness of life. I, too, wish to seek
my fortune. Well then, why not, John Saunders?
Why not, James Henderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, now indeed illusion halted! Both boys,
abashed, fell back in their chairs. &ldquo;How did you
know our names?&rdquo; asked the older of the two at
length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, fear not,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I do but seek to
prove my fitness to join the jolly brotherhood,
good mates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, honest!&rdquo; rejoined Jimmy; &ldquo;you got to tell
us how you knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let me go on. In your book, here,
I saw your father&rsquo;s name, Jimmy. I know your
father. He is Judge Willard Henderson of the
Appellate Court in the city. I was admitted to
the bar under him. He has a summer place at
the lake above here, as I know, although I have
never visited him there. I know your mother,
too, Jimmy,&mdash;so well I should not like to cause
her even a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know my auntie, Helena Emory?&rdquo; demanded
Jimmy suddenly. I felt the blood surge
into my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me,&rdquo; I rejoined, &ldquo;I only
have some gift of the second sight, as I shall now
prove to you. For instance, Jean Lafitte, I know
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
your earlier name was John Saunders, although I
never saw or heard of you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, how&rsquo;d you know that?&rdquo; demanded
the elder boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not promise to tell the secrets of my
art,&rdquo; I smiled. I did not tell him that I had seen
the name of Saunders on the tag of a shirt somewhat
soiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s name was John before you,&rdquo; I
added at a venture. He assented, half-frightened,
although I had only guessed at this, supposing
John Saunders to be a somewhat continuous
family name in a family of auburn Highlanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sells farm stuff at the hotel above,&rdquo; I ventured.
And again my guess was truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take the wagon there, sometimes, with
vegetables and milk and eggs; and so you met
Jimmy, here, and you went fishing together; and
he told you stories out of his book. I fear, John,
that your father licks you because you go fishing
on Sunday. That was why you resolved to run
away. You led Jimmy into that with you. Yesterday
you took a boat from the lake near the
hotel, and you painted her up and rigged her for
a pirate ship. You rowed across the lake to the
marsh where the little stream makes out&mdash;my
trout-stream here. You followed that stream
down, with no more trouble than ducking under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
a wire fence once in a while, until you came to
my land, and until you saw me. You were afraid
I might tell on you; and besides, you were pirates
now; and so you took me prisoner. Marry, good
Sirs, &rsquo;tis not the first time a prisoner has joined a
pirate band!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; gasped Jean T. Lafitte
Saunders. &ldquo;And you say you have never been
up to our lake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I have a map, and I know
my river heads in your lake, and that very probably
it runs out of the low marshy side. Besides,
being a boy myself, I know precisely what boys
would do. Tell me, do you think I would betray
two of the brotherhood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give us away?&rdquo; The elder pirate&rsquo;s
face was eager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I&rsquo;ll see that you don&rsquo;t get
into any trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good scout!&rdquo; ejaculated he fervently,
his freckled face flushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;that is, we hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, you see?&rdquo;
began Jimmy. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d just have camped
down here and gone back to-morrow. I was afraid
about taking the boat. Besides, I&rsquo;ve only got
about six dollars, anyhow.&rdquo; He spread his wealth
out upon the table before me frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;To-night I shall write
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
a few letters that will clear up every trouble back
home, and allow us to continue our journey to
the Spanish Main.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, will you?&rdquo; cried Jimmy, much relieved.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a good scout,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Suddenly I found myself smiling at him, I who
had smiled so rarely these years, whether in the
Selkirks or the Himalayas, in Uganda or here in
my own little wilderness&mdash;because Helena had
left me so sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I promise, you, also, must promise in
turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Used as I was, already, to the astounding
changes in Jimmy from boy to buccaneer and back
again, I was now interested at the fell scowl which
he summoned to his features, as soon as he felt
relieved as to the domestic situation. &ldquo;Speak, fellow!&rdquo;
he demanded; and folding his arms, presented
so threatening a front that I saw my man
Hiroshimi covertly lay hold upon a carving knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, my hearties,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis thus.
I&rsquo;ll sign on as sea-lawyer and scrivener, as well
as purser for the ship. Yes, I&rsquo;ll sign articles and
voyage with you for a week or a month, or two
months, or three. I&rsquo;ll provender the ship and pay
all bills of libel or demurrage in any port of call;
and by my fateful gift of second sight, which ye
have seen well proven here to-night, not only will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
I see ye safe for what ye already have done, but
will keep ye safe against any enemy we may meet,
be he whom he may!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois. &ldquo;Say on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in return I ask a boon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it, fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Already I have named it&mdash;that I, too, shall
be accepted as one of the brotherhood. Oh,
listen&rdquo;&mdash;I broke out impulsively&mdash;&ldquo;I have never
been a pirate, and I have never been a boy. I
have had everything in the world I wanted and it
made me awfully lonesome, because when you have
everything you have nothing. I have nothing to
do but eat and sleep, and hunt and fish, and read
and write, and study and think, and play my
music, here. I do not want to do these things any
more. Especially I do not want to think. Boys
do not think, and I want to be a boy. I want to
be a pirate with you. I want to seek my fortune
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We sat silent, almost solemn for a moment, so
sincere was my speech and so startling to them.
But thanks to L&rsquo;Olonnois and his saving book, illusion
came to us once more in time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye be good brother and true pirate?&rdquo;
demanded L&rsquo;Olonnois. &ldquo;And will ye take the oath
of blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
&ldquo;Brothers and good shipmates all&rdquo;&mdash;broke in
Jean Lafitte in a deep voice&mdash;&ldquo;what say ye? Shall
we put him to the oath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; responded the deep chorus of
scores of full-chested voices. Or, at least, so it
seemed to us, though, mayhap, &rsquo;twas no more than
Jimmy who spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swear him, then!&rdquo; commanded Jean Lafitte.
&ldquo;Swear him by the oath of blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t any blood!&rdquo; whispered
L&rsquo;Olonnois, aside, somewhat troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That have we, mates,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the ceremony
shall have full solemnity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took up my keen hunting knife and deliberately
and slowly opened the side of my thumb,
more to the pain of Jimmy, I fancy, than to myself,
as I could see by the twitch of his features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this blood I swear!&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;and on the
point of my blade I swear to be a true pirate;
to fight the fight of all; to divulge no plans of the
company; and to share with my brothers share
and share alike of all booty we may take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well!&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois, much impressed
and delighted, as also was his mate, very evidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my brothers,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you, also,
must swear to divulge no secret of mine that you
may learn, to tell nothing of my plans, or my
name, or the name of the port where I signed on
the rolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know your name,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;but
neither of us will give you away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Lafitte was all for opening up his own
thumb for blood, but I stopped him. &ldquo;This will
do,&rdquo; said I, and stained his fingers and those of
L&rsquo;Olonnois&mdash;who grew pale at sight of it to his
evident disgust.</p>

<p>So, thus, I became a pirate, and we three were
brother rovers of the deep. I fancied my associates
would be loyal. I was thinking of a certain
cousin of the younger pirate. Not for worlds
would I seek to pursue her now; but there had
arisen in my soul, already, a sort of strange wonder
whether some intent of fate had sent this
youngster here to remind me once more of her,
whom I would forget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;let us seek what fare
the castle offers for the night.&rdquo; I could see they
were tired and sleepy, and so found for them
bath and clean pajamas&mdash;somewhat too large to
be sure&mdash;and good beds in the wing of my log
house. And never, as I be a true pirate, never
have I seen so many and so various single-fire
and revolving short arms, in my life, as these
two buccaneers disclosed when they unbelted and
laid aside their jackets! Even thus equipped, I
found them looking enviously at my walls, where
hung weapons of many lands. I sent them to
bed happier by telling them that, in the morning,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
they should select such as they chose for the
equipment of our vessel. &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte
again. &ldquo;Gee! <em>Gee!</em>&rdquo; He was so happy that I,
too, was happy. It was L&rsquo;Olonnois who changed
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Methinks,&rdquo; said he, regarding me sternly, &ldquo;that
in yonder ivy-clad halls might dwell some lady
fair! Tell me, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched a thin arm out, in the sleeve of
my smallest pajamas, and pointed a slender finger
at the interior of my castle of dreams. Alas,
after all it was empty! My old melancholy came
back to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my brothers,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no maid has ever
passed yon door. No, nor ever will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>L&rsquo;Olonnois bent his flaxen head in dignified and
manly sympathy. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our brother
in his youth has, perhaps, been deceived by some
fair one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon which I left them for my own room.</p>

<p>If two buccaneers in my castle slept well that
night, a third did not. Anopheles might go hang.
I did not fancy my new microscope. I doubted
if my last violin were a real Strad. I did not like
the last music my dealers had sent out to me. My
studies of Confucius and Buddha might go hang,
and my new book as well. For now, before me,
came the face of a certain pirate&rsquo;s aunt, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
was indeed a lady fair. And I knew full well&mdash;as
I had known all these years, although I had
tried to deceive myself into believing otherwise&mdash;that
gladly as I had exchanged the city for the
wilderness, with equal gladness would I exchange
my leisure, all my wealth, all my belongings, for
a moment&rsquo;s touch of her hand, a half-hour of
talk heart-to-heart with her, so that, indeed, I
might know the truth; so that, at least, I might
have it direct from her, bitter though the truth
might be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE SAIL FOR THE SPANISH MAIN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN, in the morning, I passed from my
quarters toward the main room which
served me both as living-room and dining hall, I
found that my pirate guests were also early
risers. I could hear them arguing over some
matter, which proved to be no more serious
than the question of a cold bath of mornings,
Jimmy maintaining that everybody had a cold
bath every morning, whereas John insisted with
equal heat that nobody ever bathed (&ldquo;washed,&rdquo;
I think he called it), oftener than once a week,
to wit, on Saturdays only. They engaged in a
pillow fight to settle it, and as Jimmy had John
fairly well smothered by his rapid fire, I voted
that the ayes appeared to have it when they referred
the point to me.</p>

<p>As we are very remote and never visited in
my wilderness home, it is not infrequent that I
take my morning meal very much indeed in
mufti, although Hiroshimi is always most exact
himself. On this morning it occurred to us all
that pajamas made a garb more piratical and more
nautical than anything else obtainable, so we took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
breakfast&mdash;and I think Hiroshimi never served
me a breakfast more delicate and tempting&mdash;clad
as perhaps the Romans were, if they had pajamas
in those times. All went well until the keen eyes
of Jimmy, wandering about my place, noted a
certain photograph which rested on the top of my
piano&mdash;where I was much comforted always to
have it, especially of an evening, when sometimes
I played Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <i>Spring Song</i>, or other
music of the like. It was the picture of the
woman who did not know and very likely did not
care where, or how, I lived&mdash;Helena Emory, to
my mind one of the most beautiful women of her
day; and I have seen the world&rsquo;s portraits of the
world&rsquo;s beauties of all recorded days in beauty.
Toward this Jimmy ran excitedly&mdash;I, with equal
speed, endeavoring to divert him from his purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my Auntie Helen!&rdquo; he protested, when
I recovered it and placed it in my pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your Auntie fiddlesticks, Jimmy,&rdquo; said I
hastily, hoping my color was not heightened. &ldquo;It
is your grandmother! Finish your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I ought to know&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;Wouldst pit your wisdom
against one who has the second sight; have
a care, shipmate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;I know ain&rsquo;t anybody
pretty as she is, so it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
&ldquo;Jimmy L&rsquo;Olonnois,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us reason about
this. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lemme see it, then. I can tell in a minute.
Why don&rsquo;t you lemme see it, then?&rdquo; He was
eager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shipmate,&rdquo; I replied to him, &ldquo;the hand is sometimes
quicker than the eye, and the mind slower
than the heart. For that reason I can not agree
to your request.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;d <em>he</em> be doing with Miss Emory&rsquo;s
picture, Jimmy?&rdquo; argued Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;It
may be that, in your haste, you have confused in
your mind, Jimmy, some portrait with that of the
Princess Am&egrave;lie Louise, of Furstenburg.&rdquo; (I had
indeed sometimes commented on the likeness of
Helena Emory to that light-hearted old-world
beauty.) Jimmy did not know that a photograph
of the princess herself, also, stood upon the piano
top, nor did he fully grasp the truth of that old
saying that the hand is quicker than the eye. At
least, he gazed somewhat confused at the portrait
which I now produced before his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very charming young lady of rank, who
eloped with a young man not of rank. In short,
although she did not marry a chauffeur, she did
marry an automobile agent. And surely, Jimmy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
your Auntie Helen&mdash;whoever she may be&mdash;would
do no such thing as that and still claim to be a
cousin of a L&rsquo;Olonnois?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You can&rsquo;t always tell what a
girl&rsquo;s going to do,&rdquo; said Jimmy sagely. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t think Auntie Helen&rsquo;s going to marry a auto
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jimmy?&rdquo; (I found pleasure and dread
alike in this conversation.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because everybody says she&rsquo;s going to get married
to Mr. Davidson, and he&rsquo;s a commission
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, I am sure, my face did not flush. It may
have paled. I tried to be composed. I reached
for the melon dish and remarked, &ldquo;Yes? And
who is he? And really, who is your Auntie
Helena, Jimmy, and what does she look like?&rdquo; I
spoke with a fine air of carelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks like the princess, you said,&rdquo; replied
Jimmy. &ldquo;And Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s rich. He&rsquo;s got a
house on our lake, this summer, and he lives in
New York and has offices in Chicago, and travels
a good deal. He has some sort of factory, too,
and he&rsquo;s awful rich. I like him pretty well. He
knows how all the ball clubs stand, both leagues,
every day in the year. You ought to know him,
because then you might get to know my Auntie
Helena. If they got married, like as not, I could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
take you up to their house. I thought everybody
knew Mr. Davidson, and my Auntie Helena, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody did. Why should I not know Cal
Davidson, one of the decentest chaps in the world?
Why not, since we belonged to half a dozen of the
same clubs in New York and other cities? Why
not, since this very summer I had put my private
yacht (named oddly enough, the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>)
in commission for the first season in three years,
and chartered her for the summer around Mackinaw,
and a cruise down the Mississippi to the
Gulf that fall? Why not, since I had still unbanked
the handsome check Davidson had insisted
on my taking as charter money for the last quarter?</p>

<p>Davidson! Of all men I had counted him my
friend. And now here was he, reputed to be about
to marry the girl who, as he knew, must have
known, ought to have known, was all the world
to me! Even if she would have none of me, and
even though I had no shadow of claim on her&mdash;even
though we had parted not once but a dozen times,
and at last in a final parting&mdash;Davidson ought to
have known, must have known! And my own
yacht! Why, no man may know what may go
forward in a yachting party. And, if perchance
that fall he could persuade to accompany him
Helena and her chaperon (I made no doubt that
would be her Aunt Lucinda; for Helena&rsquo;s mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
died when she was a child, and she was somewhat
alone, although in rather comfortable circumstances)
what could not so clever a man as Davidson,
I repeat, one with so much of a way with
women, accomplish in a journey so long as that,
with no other man as his rival? It would be just
like Cal Davidson to go ashore at St. Louis long
enough to find a chaplain, and then go on ahead
for a honeymoon around the world&mdash;on my boat,
with my.... No, she was not mine ... but
then....</p>

<p>All my life I have tried to be fair, even with my
own interests at stake. I tried now to be fair; and
I failed! I could see but one side to this case.
Davidson must be found at once, must be halted
in mid-career.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Hiroshimi came in
with the morning&rsquo;s mail and telegrams, all of
which at my place come in from the railway, ten
miles or so, by rural free delivery. I paid small
attention to him, most of my mail, these days,
having to do with gasoline pumps or patent hay
rakes and lists from my gun and tackle dealers
and such like.</p>

<p>Hiroshimi coughed. &ldquo;Supposing Honorable like
to see these yellow wire envelopings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced down and idly opened the telegram.
It was from Cal Davidson himself, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
<p>&ldquo;Name best price outright sale bill Helen to me
answer Chicago.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>So then, the scoundrel actually was on his way
down the lakes, headed for the South, even thus
early in the season! I knew, of course, that Bill
Helen meant <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. As though I would
sell my boat to him, of all men! It might almost
as well have been a sale of Helena herself outright,
as this cursed telegram stated. I crumpled
the sheet in my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Honorable contemplates some answering of
mail this morning, it will be one ow-wore till the
miserable pony mail carry all man comes,&rdquo; ventured
Hiroshimi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing this morning, Hiro,&rdquo; I managed to
choke out, &ldquo;and, Hiro, make ready my bag, the
small one, for a journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-s-s-s!&rdquo; hissed Hiroshimi, which was his way
of saying, &ldquo;Yes, sir, very well, sir.&rdquo; Surprise he
neither showed now nor at any time; and since
he never could tell at what hour I might conclude
to start for his country or Europe or Africa or
some other land for a stay of weeks or months,
there was perhaps some warrant for his calm. He
had less to do when I was away; although I always
suspected him of poaching my trout with his
infernal Japanese methods of angling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
At this moment L&rsquo;Olonnois saw, through the
open door, a red squirrel which scampered up a
tree. At once he forgot all about his Auntie Helen
and scampered off in pursuit, followed presently
by Lafitte. This gave me time to decide upon a
plan.... At last, I lifted my head again....
Why not, then?</p>

<p>When L&rsquo;Olonnois returned from the chase of
the squirrel, he was all L&rsquo;Olonnois and none Jimmy
Henderson. The spell of his drama was upon him
once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho, mate,&rdquo; he began, scowling most vilely
at me, &ldquo;the sun is high in the heavens, yet we
linger here. Let us up anchor, hoist the top-gallant
mast and set sail for the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy&rsquo;s nautical terms might have been open
to criticism, but there was no denying the bold
and manly import of his speech. My own heart
jumped well enough with it now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well, shipmate,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Come, get ready
your togs and your weapons, and let us away. As
you say, the good ship tugs at her anchor chains
this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I managed to better the wardrobe of both boys
by certain ducks and linens from my own store,
albeit a world too large. Lafitte, none too happy
at being thus uncongenially clean, was delight itself
when set to selecting an armament from my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
collection. He chose three bright and clean Japanese
swords, special blades of the Samurai armorers,
forged long before Mutsuhito&rsquo;s grandfather was a
boy&mdash;I had paid a rare price for them in Japan.
To these he added three basket-handled cutlasses,
which I had obtained in London, each almost old
enough to have belonged to the crew of Drake
himself. A short-barreled magazine pistol for
each of us was his concession to the present unromantic
age. As for Jimmy, he insisted on a
small bore rifle as well as a shotgun. &ldquo;We might
see something,&rdquo; he remarked laconically.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, I persuaded my associates to lay
aside most of their somewhat archaic artillery.
Neither had taken any thought of other supplies.
Hiroshimi, however, now appeared, bearing, in
addition to my hand luggage, two hampers, a roll
of blankets and a silk tent in its canvas wrapper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honorable is embarked in those small-going
boat that is made tied to the bank?&rdquo; inquired Hiroshimi.
He had said nothing to me about my guests,
or asked how they came; but as I knew he would
find out all about it, anyhow, after his own fashion,
I had not mentioned anything to him, or told him
what to do. I only nodded now, relying on his
efficiency. He now approached my young pirates,
and rather against their will, removed from them
some of their burden of weapons, slinging about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
himself bundles, baskets, bags and cutlery, until
he almost disappeared from view. He cast on me
a reproachful gaze, however, as he took from
Lafitte&rsquo;s hand the bared blade of the old Samurai
sword, and noted the ancient inscription on blade
and scabbard as he sheathed it reverently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it say, Hiro?&rdquo; I asked of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very old talk, Honorable,&rdquo; answered Hiroshimi.
&ldquo;It say, &lsquo;Oh, Honorable Gentleman who carry me,
I invite you to make high and noble adventurings.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me carry it, Hiro,&rdquo; said I; and I tucked
it under my own arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed L&rsquo;Olonnois. &ldquo;Then you are
going with us? And did you write the letters that
you promised us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always keep my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll be all right back home about mother
and the boat? I&rsquo;ll give you my six dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need. I told you, if you would
make me one of the crew of the <i>Sea Rover</i> and
let me seek my fortune with you, I would gladly
pay all the reckoning of our journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how long will we be gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till after your school begins, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how far are you going with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spang! to the Spanish Main!&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>So then we set forth down my woodland path.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I ACQUIRE A FRIEND</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E proceeded, therefore, through the wood,
sweet in the dew of morning, among many
twittering birds, and so came, presently, to
the end of my path, where the little gate shuts
it off from my mowing meadow; at the upper end
of which, it may be remembered, the good ship
<i>Sea Rover</i> lay anchored. The grass stood waist-high
and wet in the dew as we turned along the
meadow side, and L&rsquo;Olonnois flinched a bit, although
Lafitte waded along carelessly.</p>

<p>I observed that each boy had now thrust into
his hat band a turkey feather, picked up, en route,
along my field&rsquo;s edge. Jimmy was not sure of the
correctness of this; and admitted that, sometimes,
he had read literature having to do with Indian
fighting, as well as piratical enterprises. I suggested
that, to my mind, nothing quite took the
place of the regulation red kerchief bound about
the head; whereat, gravely, both L&rsquo;Olonnois and
Lafitte discarded their hats and feathers, for the
bandannas which I proffered them. Having bound
these about their foreheads, a great courage and
confidence came to them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
L&rsquo;Olonnois drew his sword, and with some care
placed the blade between his teeth. &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lafitte, himself swept by his friend&rsquo;s
imagination, and preparing to place his cutlass in
his mouth also. &ldquo;Let us approach the vessel with
care, lest the enemy be about.&rdquo; So saying, each
pirate with a mouthful of cold steel, and a hand
shading his red-kerchiefed brow, stole through my
clump of birches toward the bend, where the boat
had first surprised me; myself following, somewhat
put to it to refrain from laughter, although
one rarely laughs in the young hours of the day,
and myself rarely, at all.</p>

<p>We were greeted by no hostile shot, and found
our vessel quite as we had left her, as I could see
at a glance when we neared the bank; but, none
the less, something stirred in the bushes. A growl
and a sudden barking, greeted Hiroshimi as he
approached the boat in advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Tige!&rdquo; called out Lafitte. The dog&mdash;a
dog none too beautiful, and now just a bit forlorn&mdash;approached
us, alternately wagging in
friendship and retreating in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that!&rdquo; said Jimmy.
&ldquo;We left him back at the lake&mdash;sent him home
half a dozen times. How&rsquo;d he get here, and how&rsquo;d
he know where we was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t a-swum the lake,&rdquo; assented John.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
&ldquo;And it was more&rsquo;n ten miles around; and how
could he smell where we went, on the water? Come
here, Tige, you blame fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he is no fool, this dog, but a
creature of great reason, else he never could have
found you. And I&rsquo;ll be bound he is as keen for
adventure as any of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is coming here last night two ow-wore
after dinner,&rdquo; said the omniscient Hiroshimi. &ldquo;Also
he bite me on leg. He, also, is malefactor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has allotted to himself the duty of caring
for the property of his masters, Hiro,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and hence is not really a malefactor. Besides,
since he would not leave the boat and follow our
trail, he is by this time hungry. Feed him, Hiro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Hiroshimi was not eager to approach the
piratical canine again; so I, myself, fished something
from a hamper and called the dog to me.
He ate gladly and most gratefully.</p>

<p>Now, it is a strange thing to say, but it is the
truth, I had never before in my life fed a dog!
I had won many knotty suits at law, had solved
many hard problems dealing with human nature&mdash;and
had found human nature for the most part
rarely glad or grateful&mdash;but I have never owned
or even fed a dog. A strange new feeling came
in my throat now. Suddenly I swallowed some
invisible intangible thing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what breed of dog is this?&rdquo;
Indeed, it was hard to tell offhand, although he
had the keen head of a collie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s just one o&rsquo; them partial dogs,&rdquo;
answered John, &ldquo;mostly shepherd, maybe; I dunno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Partial shall be his name. And is
he yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He runs round on the farm. He goes with
Jimmy an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, will you sell me Partial?&rdquo; I asked this
suddenly, realizing that my voice might sound
odd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d ye want him fer?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
be a nuisance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. See how faithful he has been, see
how grateful he is; and how wise. He reasoned
where you were as well as I reasoned who you
were. He knows now that we are talking about
him, and knows that I am his friend&mdash;see him
look at me; see him come over and stand by me.
John, do you think&mdash;do you believe a dog, this
dog, would learn to like me, ever? Would he
understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John judicially, standing sword in
hand, &ldquo;I dunno. Someways, maybe dogs and boys
understands quicker. But you understand us.
Maybe he&rsquo;d understand you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well reasoned, Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perhaps
your logic is better than you know, at least, I
hope so. And now I offer you yonder magazine
pistol as your own in fee, if you will sign over to
me all your right, title and interest, in Partial,
here. Evidently he belongs with us. He seems
to care for us. And I experience some odd sort
of feeling, which I can not quite describe. Perhaps
it is only that I feel like a boy, and one that
is going to own a dog. Is it a bargain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! You c&rsquo;n have him for nuthin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
Lafitte. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t worth nothin&rsquo;. Besides, I can&rsquo;t
charge a brother of the flag anything; anyhow,
not you.&rdquo; I inferred that Jean Lafitte, also, was
going to grow up into one of those men like myself,
cursed with a reticence and shyness in some
matters, and so winning a reputation of oddness
or coldness, against all the real and passionate
protest of his own soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, brother,&rdquo; I said to him: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not offer
you trade, but gift. Let it be that if I can win
the dog, and if he will take me as his master and
friend, he shall be mine. And you take the pistol,
and have a care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Lafitte shyly, yet delightedly,
as I could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Partial!&rdquo; I called to the dog; and being
young and friendly, and attached to neither in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
particular, and only in general worshiping the
creature Boy, he came to me! I fed him, stroked
him, looked into his eyes. And in a few moments
he put his feet on my shoulders, and licked at
my ear, and began to talk to me in low eager
whines, and rubbed his muzzle against my cheek,
and said all that a dog could say in oath of feudal
service, pledging loyalty of life and limb. At
which I felt very odd indeed; and began to see
the world had many things in it of which I had
never known; but which, now, I was resolved to
know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honorable is embarking those malefactor canine
thing with so much impediments in this small-going
boat?&rdquo; inquired Hiroshimi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;At once. All four of us.
Put the stuff aboard, Hiro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, somewhat crowded as the <i>Sea Rover</i> was,
with three boys and a dog, not to mention our
supplies and our armament, at last we were afloat
with crew and cargo aboard. Hiro was not surprised,
and asked no questions. With the salaam
with which he announced dinner, he now announced
his own departure for his duties at my
deserted house; and as he walked he never
turned around for curious gaze. Often, often
have I, in my readings in the Eastern philosophy,
endeavored to analyze and to emulate this Oriental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
calm, this dismissal from the soul of things small,
things unessential and things unavoidable. An
enviable character, my boy Hiroshimi.</p>

<p>Now all was bustle and confusion aboard the
good ship <i>Sea Rover</i>. &ldquo;Stand by the main braces!&rdquo;
roared Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; replied the crew, that is to say,
Jimmy L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard a lee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard a lee it is, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoist the top-gallant mainsail an&rsquo; clew all
alow an&rsquo; aloft!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man the capstan! All hands to the starboard
mizzen chains! Heave away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heave away!&rdquo; rejoined our gallant crew, never
for a moment in doubt as to the captain&rsquo;s meaning.
And, indeed, he gave a push with an oar at
the bank, which thrust us into the smart current
of my little river.</p>

<p>We were afloat! We were off to seek our fortune!</p>

alt="The man and two boys in a boat, one of the boys rowing" />
<span class="caption">I, too, stood, shading my eyes with my hand</span>
</div>

<p>Ah, what a fine new world was this which lay
before us! But for one thing, this had no doubt
been the happiest moment in my life. For, always,
the attaining of knowledge, the growth of
a man&rsquo;s mind and soul, had to me seemed the one
ambition worth a man&rsquo;s while; and now, as I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
might well be assured, I had learned more and
grown more, these last twelve hours or so, than I
had in any twelve years of my life before. Before
me, indeed, had opened a vast and wonderful
world. That morning, as we swept around curve
after curve of the swift trout-stream that I loved
so well, among my alders, through my bits of
wood, along my hills&mdash;with Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois
standing, each alert, silent, peering ahead under his
flat hand to see what might lie ahead (I astern
with Partial&rsquo;s head on my knee), I felt rise in my
soul the same sweet grateful feeling that I had
when the new world of music opened to me, what
time I first caught the real meaning of the <i>Fr&uuml;hlingslied</i>.
My heart leaped anew in my bosom,
for the time forgetting its sadness. I saw that
the world after all does hold faith and loyalty
and friendship and perpetual, self-renewing Youth....
I also rose, cast my hat aside, and with one
hand reaching down to touch my friend&rsquo;s head,
I, too, stood, shading my eyes with my edged
hand, peering ahead into this strange new world
that lay ahead of me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I ACHIEVE A NAME</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>O winding is my trout river, and so extensive
are my lands along it, that it was not until
nearly noon that our progress, sometimes halted
by shallows, again swift in the deeper reaches,
brought the <i>Sea Rover</i> to the lower edge of my
estate. Here, the river was deeper and more silent,
the waters were not quite so cold, but as we passed
a high hardwood bridge from which issued a cool
spring of water, I suggested a halt in our voyage,
to which my companions, readily enough, agreed.
We, therefore, disembarked and prepared to have
our luncheon.</p>

<p>It was obvious to me that Jean Lafitte and
Henri L&rsquo;Olonnois were not on their first expedition
out-of-doors, for they set about gathering wood
and water in workmanlike fashion. They did not
yet fully classify me, so, in boyish shyness, left
me largely ignored, or waited till I should demonstrate
myself to them. It was, therefore, with
delicacy that I ventured any suggestions from the
place where Partial and I sat in the shade watching
them.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the fact that I had been a
hunter and traveler, and had met success in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
field; yet the truth is, I began all that late in life,
and deliberately. To me, used to exact habit of
thought in all things, and accustomed to be
governed by trained reason alone, it was never
enough to say that a thing was partly done, or
well enough done to pass: only the best possible
way had any appeal to me. I brought my reason
to bear on every situation in life. Thus, I studied
an investment carefully, and before going into it,
I knew what the result would be. My investments,
therefore, always have prospered, because they
were not based on guess or chance, as nine-tenths
of all the public&rsquo;s business ventures are. In the
same way, I had gone deliberately about the matter
of winning the regard of the only woman I ever
saw who seemed to me much worth while. I
argued and reasoned with Helena Emory that she
should marry me, proving to her by every rule of
logic that, not only was she the most lovable
woman in all the records of the world, but, also,
that love such as mine never had before been
known in the world. Sometimes, as I logically
proved the fitness of our union, and grew warm
at my own accuracy, she wavered, relented,
warmed: and then again, forgetting my argument,
she would relapse into womanlike frivolity once
more.... I did not like to think of this, as I
sat in the shade with Partial. It cost me much
in self-respect, irritated me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
But, having studied sport and outdoor living
deliberately as I had studied the law and business
and Helena, I had rather a thorough grounding,
on life in the open, for I had read every authority
obtainable; whereas my young associates had read
none. So cautiously, now and then, I suggested
little things to them, as that the fire need not be
so large, and would do better if confined between
two green side logs. I taught them how to boil
the kettle quickly, how to make tea, and also, more
difficult, how to make coffee; how to cook bacon
just enough, and how to cook fish&mdash;for I had
taken a few trout earlier in the day&mdash;and how to
make toast without charring it to cinders. Again,
I delighted them by telling them of little camping
devices, and quite won their hearts when I found
among Hiroshimi&rsquo;s packages, a small camp griddle
with folding legs, of my own devising. It was
quite clean and new, but it performed as I felt
quite sure it would. In fact, reason will govern
all things&mdash;except a woman.</p>

<p>We ate <i>al fresco</i>, as true buccaneers of the main,
and grew better and better acquainted. It occurred
to me that mayhap the nautical education
of my associates was, after all, somewhat superficial,
so I set about mending it by explaining
something of the rigging of the ship; and I gave
them, by means of the <i>Sea Rover&rsquo;s</i> bowline, some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
lessons in sailorman splices and knots. The bow-line-in-a-bight,
the sheet-bend, the clinch-knot, the
jam-knot, the fisherman&rsquo;s water-knot, the stevedore&rsquo;s
slip-knot, the dock-hand&rsquo;s round-turns and
half-hitches for cable makefast, the magnus-hitch,
the fool&rsquo;s-knot, the cat&rsquo;s-cradle, the sheep-shank,
the dog-shank, and many others&mdash;all of which I
had learned in books and in practise&mdash;I did for
them over and over again; just as I could have
done for them a half-dozen different ways of
throwing the diamond-hitch in a pack-train, or
the stirrup-hitch in a cow camp, or many other
of the devices of men who live in the open; for
beginning late in life in these things, I had studied
them hard and faithfully.</p>

<p>I could see&mdash;and I noted it with much gratification&mdash;that
I was rising in the estimation of my
pirates. It pleased me not at all to show that I
knew more than they of these things, for I was
older and my mind was long my trained servant;
but I had monstrous delight in seeing myself accepted
as one fit to associate with them. Once
or twice, I saw the two draw apart in some debate
which I knew had to do with me. &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo;
Lafitte would begin; and L&rsquo;Olonnois would demur.
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t just like that one,&rdquo; he would say.
By nightfall&mdash;and I presume I do not need to
recall all the incidents of our afternoon, or of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
our pitching camp by the riverside an hour before
sundown&mdash;I learned what was the subject
of their argument. I had been admitted to the
pirates&rsquo; band, but the question was over my name.</p>

<p>We sat by our fireside, before our little tent,
after a pleasant meal which I know was well
cooked because I cooked it myself&mdash;trout, a young
squirrel, and toast, and real coffee&mdash;and Partial
was close at my knee, having obviously adopted
me. We were fifteen or twenty miles from my
house, nearly twice that from their homes, but
the world, itself, seemed very remote from us.
We reveled in a new luxurious world of rare
deeds, rare dreams all our own. I was conjuring
up some new argument to put before Helena
should I ever see her again&mdash;as of course I never
should&mdash;when Lafitte rolled over on the grass
and looked up at us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was just saying,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that you
didn&rsquo;t have no name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true. I have not told you my name,
nor have you asked it. Had you been impolite,
you might have learned it by prying about my
place.&rdquo; I spoke gravely and with approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t know who you was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be so. Let me be a man of no name.
A name is of no consequence, and neither am I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho, now, that ain&rsquo;t so. I never seen a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
better&mdash;now, I never seen&mdash;&rdquo; Jean Lafitte&rsquo;s reticence
in friendship, again, was getting the better of
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we said we&rsquo;d call you Black Bart,&rdquo; added
L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a most excellent name,&rdquo; said I after
some thought. &ldquo;At present, I can find no objection
to it, except that I wear no beard at all and
would have a red or brown one if I did; and that
Black Bart was rather a pirate of the land than
of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; queried L&rsquo;Olonnois. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he a
pirate, too, never?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a famous pirate chief known as
Bluebeard or Blackbeard, and it may be, sometimes,
they called him Black Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he a awful desper&rsquo;t sort of pirate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is said to have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a awful desper&rsquo;t name,&rdquo; said
Jimmy: &ldquo;like as though he&rsquo;d fill up his ship with
captured maidens, an&rsquo; put all rivals to the sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such, indeed, shipmate,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;was his
reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; concluded L&rsquo;Olonnois, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t
think o&rsquo; any better name&rsquo;n that, because we know
that is just what you would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(So, then, my reputation was advancing!)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you never a pirate before, honest?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
queried Lafitte at this juncture. &ldquo;Because, you
seem like a real pirate to us. We been, lots of
times, over on the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be because my father was always
called a pirate,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;You see, in these
days, there are not so many pirates who really
scuttle ships and cut throats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. &rsquo;Tis in my blood, my bold shipmate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We knew it,&rdquo; concluded L&rsquo;Olonnois calmly.
&ldquo;So, after now, we&rsquo;ll call you Black Bart. You
can let your whiskers grow, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Well, we will at least take
the whiskers under advisement, as the court would
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must be an awful long ways from home,&rdquo;
ventured L&rsquo;Olonnois, after a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of miles our good ship has ploughed
the deep, and as yet has raised no sail above the
horizon,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you&mdash;now&mdash;do you&mdash;well, anyhow, do you
have any idea of where we are going?&rdquo; demanded
Lafitte, shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;well&mdash;now then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer I drew from my pocket a map and
a compass; the latter mostly for effect, since I
knew very well the bed of our river must shape
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
our course for many a mile. On the map I pointed
out how, presently, our river would run into a
lake, into which, also, ran another river; and would
emerge on the other side much larger. I showed
them that down that other river, as, indeed, down
mine, logs used to float from the pine forests&mdash;many
of my father&rsquo;s logs, of ownership said to
have been piratical&mdash;and I showed how, presently,
this stream would carry us into one of the ancient
waterways down which millions of wealth in
timber have come; and explained about the wild
crews of river runners who once ran the rafts
down that great highway, and into the greater
highway of the Mississippi; whence men might in
due time arrive upon the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any way a fellow can get across from
Lake Michigan into the Mississippi River?&rdquo; demanded
Lafitte, who was of a practical turn of
mind: and on the map I showed him all the old
trails of the fur traders, explorers and adventurers,
French and English, who had discovered our
America long ago; whereat their eyes kindled and
their tongues went dumb.</p>

<p>At last, I told them we must to our hammocks;
and soon our bloody band was deep in sleep. At
least, so much might have been said for Lafitte
and L&rsquo;Olonnois. Alone of the band of sea rovers
myself, Black Bart, sat musing by the fire, the
head of my friend, Partial, in my lap.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE HAVE AN ADVENTURE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>UR band of hardy adventurers arose with
the sun on the morning following our first
night in bivouac, and by noon of that day, thanks,
perhaps, in some measure to my own work at the
oars, and a sail which we rigged from a corner
of the tent, we had passed into and through the
lake which our map had showed us. Now we
were below the edge of the pine woods, and our
stream ran more sluggishly, between banks of cattails
or of waving marsh grasses. We put out a
trolling line, and took a bass or so; and once
Lafitte, firing chance-medley into a passing flock
of plover, knocked down a half-dozen, so that we
bade fair to have enough for dinner that night. It
was all a new world for us. No one might tell
what lay around the next bend of our widening
waterway. We were explorers. A virgin world
lay before us. The nature of the country along
the stream kept the settlements back a distance;
so that to us, now, in reality, retracing one of
the ancient fur-trading routes, we might almost
have been the first to break these silences.</p>

<p>Toward nightfall we came into a more rolling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
and more park-like region; our prow was now
heading to the westward, for the general course
of the great river beyond. I had no notion to visit
the city of Chicago, and our route lay far above
that which must be taken by any large craft bound
for the Mississippi route to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Farms now came down to the water&rsquo;s edge in
places, villages offered mill-pond dams&mdash;around
which, in scowling reticence, we portaged the <i>Sea
Rover</i>, unmindful alike of queries and of jeers.
I found time to post additional letters now. Indeed,
I was preparing for a long and determined
enterprise. It was the <i>Sea Rover</i> against the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>; and, did the skipper of the latter
loll along in flanneled ease and luxury, not so
with the hardy band of cutthroats who manned
our smaller and more mobile craft, men used to
hardships, content to drink spring water instead
of sparkling wines, and to eat the product of their
own weapons.</p>

<p>We were I do not know how far from our first
encampment, perhaps thirty miles or more, when
toward five o&rsquo;clock of the evening we concluded
to land at a wooded grassy bank which offered
a good camping place. We made all fast, and in
a few moments had our tent up and a little fire
going, Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois, at this, happy as
any two pirates I ever have seen; and were on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
the point of spreading our canvas table cover upon
the grass, when we heard a gruff voice hail us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh! What&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo; there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We turned, expecting to meet some irate farmer
on whose land perhaps we innocently were trespassing;
but the figure which now emerged from
the screening bushes was rougher, bolder, and in
some indescribable way wilder, than that of a
farmer. I could not, at first, assign the fellow a
place, for I knew this was an old and well settled
country, and not supposed to be overrun with
tramps or campers. He was a stout man nearly of
middle age, dirty and ill clad, his coarse shirt open
at the neck, his legs clad in old overalls, his hat and
shoes very much the worse for wear. His face
was covered with a rough beard, and so brown and
so begrimed that, at once, I guessed this must be
some dweller in the open. Yet he seemed no
tramp; and even if he were, he had no right to
hail us in this fashion.</p>

<p>I only looked at him, and made no answer,
feeling none due. He came out into the open,
followed by a nondescript dog, which had the lack
of decency&mdash;and also of discretion&mdash;to attack my
dog Partial with no parley or preliminary. I wot
not of what stock Partial came, but somewhere
in his ancestry must have been stark fighting
strain. Mutely and sternly, as became a gentleman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
he joined issue; and so well had he learned
the art of war that in the space of a few moments,
in spite of the loud outcry of the owner of the invading
cur, he had him on his back in a throat
grip which was the end of the battle and bade fair
soon to be the end of the enemy.</p>

<p>The man who had accosted us caught up a club
and made toward Partial with intent to kill him.
Then, indeed, we all sprang into action. In two
strides I was before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop that!&rdquo; I said to him quickly, but I hope
not angrily. &ldquo;Call him off, Jack!&rdquo; I cried to
Lafitte at the same time.</p>

<p>The sound of conflict ceased as Partial was
persuaded to release his fallen foe, and the latter
disappeared, with more wisdom as to attacking
a band of pirates. His owner, however, was not
so easily daunted. He still advanced toward Partial,
and as I still intervened, he made a vicious
side blow at me with his club.</p>

<p>It all happened, almost, in the twinkling of an
eye. Here, then, was an adventure, and before
the end of our second day!</p>

<p>There was not time to learn or to ask the reason
for this man&rsquo;s animosity toward us, and, indeed,
no thought of that came to my mind. A man
may lay tongue to one&mdash;within certain bounds&mdash;and
one will only walk away from him; but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
touch of another man&rsquo;s hand or weapon is quite
another matter. That arouses the unthinking
blood, and follows then, no matter the issue, the
<i>gaudium certaminis</i>, with no care as to odds or
evens. Wherefore, even as the club whizzed by
to my side step, I came back from the other foot
and smote the hostile stranger on the side of the
neck so stiffly that he faltered and almost
dropped. Then seeing that I was so much lighter
than himself and perhaps valuing himself against
me purely on a basis of avoirdupois, pound for
pound, he gathered and came at me, roaring out
blasphemy and obscenity which I had rather Lafitte
and L&rsquo;Olonnois had not heard.</p>

<p>I had not often fought in fact, but knew that,
sometimes, a gentleman must fight. What astonished
me now was the fact that fighting contained
no manner of repugnance to me. With a certain
joy I met my foe, circled with him, exchanged
blows with him&mdash;unequally it is true, for I was
cool as though trying a cause at law, and he was
very angry: so that he got most of my leads, and
I but few of his, albeit jarring me enough to make
my ears sing and my eyes blur somewhat, although
of pain I was no more conscious than a fighting
dog. The turf was soft underfoot, and the space
wide, so that we fought very happily and comfortably
over perhaps a hundred feet of country,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
first one and then the other coming in; until at
last I had him so well blown that he stood, and
I knew we must now end it toe to toe. I bethought
me of a trick of my old boxing teacher,
and stood before him with arms curved wide
apart, inviting him to come into what seemed an
opening. He rushed, and my left fist caught him
on the neck. He straightened to finish me, but I
stooped and brought my right in a round-arm
blow, full and hard into the small of his back
and at one side. It sickened him, and before he
could rally, I stepped behind him, and having
no ethics save the necessity of subduing him, I
caught up his arm by the wrist, and slipping
under it with my shoulder, pulled it down till he
howled: a trick, only one of very many, which
Hiroshimi patiently had taught me.</p>

<p>That very naturally ended our contest, and it
was near to ending our war-like neighbor as well.
During this warfare, which was short or long, I
knew not, my associates, stunned and perhaps
fearful, had sat silent; at least, I neither heard
nor saw them. But now, all at once, over my
shoulder I saw both Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois running
in to my assistance. Each held in hand a
bared blade of the samurai, and had I not shouted
out to them to refrain, I have small doubt that in
the most piratical and unsamuraic fashion they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
mayhap would have disemboweled my captive; for
the old swords were keen as razors, and my
friends were as red of eyesight as myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; I called to them, even as our victim
writhed and roared in terror. &ldquo;Drop your
weapons&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo; They obeyed, shamefacedly
and with regret, as I am convinced: for
illusion with them, at times, indeed overleaped
the centuries, and they were back in a time of
blood: even as I was in a stone-age wrath for
my own part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, Jack,&rdquo; I ordered, &ldquo;and you, too,
Jimmy. Do you see how I have him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach,&rdquo; said Lafitte.
&ldquo;Make him holler!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, easing off the strain on the
wrenched arm, &ldquo;he has already &lsquo;hollered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure, &rsquo;nuff, &rsquo;nuff!&mdash;&mdash;ye!&rdquo; cried our captive,
who, now, was in mortal terror and much
contrition, seeing both flesh and blood and cold
steel had all the best of him. &ldquo;Lemme go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I assented; &ldquo;we did not ask you
to come, and do not want you to stay. But, first,
I must use you in a few demonstrations to my
young friends. Jack,&rdquo;&mdash;and I motioned to him
with my head&mdash;&ldquo;get behind him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly, his three-cornered gray eyes narrowed,
Lafitte skipped back of my man, and with no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
word from me he fastened on the other wrist so
suddenly the man had no warning, and with a
strong heave of all his body he doubled that arm
up also. Much roaring now, and many protestations,
for when our prisoner began with abuse, we
could change it into supplication by raising his
bent arms no more than one inch or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jimmy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;go in front of him,
and put a thumb in the corner of his jaw, on each
side. Press up until he begs our pardon.&rdquo; And,
faith, my blue-eyed pirate, so far from shuddering
at the task, at last managed to find those certain
nerve centers known to all efficient policemen; and
very promptly, the man made signs he would like
to beg the boy&rsquo;s pardon and did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, give me that arm, Jack,&rdquo; I resumed
calmly, since our subject had no more fight left
in him than a sack of meal. &ldquo;So. Now go
around and put your thumbs in his eyes&mdash;no, not
really in his eyes, but in the middle of the bone
above his eyes. So. Now, ask this boy&rsquo;s pardon,
or I&rsquo;ll twist your arms off.&rdquo; And he asked it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do it if you&rsquo;d fight fair!&rdquo; he
bellowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I not?&rdquo; I asked. And cast him free.
&ldquo;Come on again, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of them kids,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d
stick me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, they would not,&rdquo; said I; but still he would
not come on. Then I made a quick catch at his
wrist, edgewise, and rolled my thumb along it at
a certain place where the nerves lie close to the
edge of the bone, as any policeman knows; and he
would follow me, then. So I led him to our little
camp-fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;be seated,&rdquo; and he sat.
I asked him if he would shake hands with me and
my boys and make up. He was very sullen, but,
at last, did so, not cheerfully, I fear, for he was
not of good blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I demanded then, seeing that the
triumph of calm reason had been sufficient in his
case, &ldquo;why did you come here, and why do you
try to drive us off, who are only on a peaceful
journey as pirates, seeking our fortune?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pirates!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Just what I thought.
What&rsquo;s the use my leasin&rsquo; the pearl fer a mile
along here if anybody can come and camp, and
go to work, right alongside o&rsquo; me? If old farmer
Snider, that owns this land, hadn&rsquo;t gone to town
I&rsquo;d have the law on ye. Me payin&rsquo; my money in
and gettin&rsquo; no protection. Fishin&rsquo;s rotten, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I now perceived that we had encountered one
of those half-nomad characters, a fresh-water
pearl fisherman, such as those who, for some
years, with varying fortune, have combed the sand-bars
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
of our inland river for the fresh-water mussels
which sometimes, like oysters, secrete valuable
pearls or nacreous bits known as slugs. This explained
much to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the law,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Farmer Snider can
not lease the highway of yonder river where the
<i>Sea Rover</i> passes. But I know also the law of
the wilderness. One trapper does not intrude on
another who has first located his country. We will
pass on to-morrow. Meantime, if you don&rsquo;t mind,
we will go with you to your camp and see how you
do your work. Please forget that we have had
any trouble. Had you but spoken thus at first,
and not borne war against these bold pirates, all
would have been well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at me oddly, evidently thinking my
mind touched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; I said, wiping the blood from my face,
and passing him also a basin of water, &ldquo;you fought
well and the wonder is you did not kill me with
one of those swings or swipes of yours. They
were crooked and awkward, but they came hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He grinned and saved his face further by saying:
&ldquo;Well, you was three to one ag&rsquo;in me.&rdquo; I
smiled and let it stand so: and after a while, he
arose stiffly and we all passed back into the wood.</p>

<p>We found that we were upon a little island,
between two shallow arms of the stream. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
camp of the pearl fisher lay at the lower end; and
never have I seen or smelled so foul a place for
human habitation. The one large tent served as
shelter, and a rude awning sheltered the ruder
table in the open air. But directly about the tent,
and all around it in every direction, lay heaps of
clam shells, most of them opened, some not yet
ready for opening. I had smelled the same odor&mdash;and
had not learned to like it&mdash;in far-off Ceylon,
at the great pearl fisheries of the Orient.
The &ldquo;clammer&rdquo; seemed immune.</p>

<p>Presently, he introduced to us a woman, very
old, extraordinarily forbidding of visage, and unspeakably
profane of speech, who emerged from
the tent; his mother, he said. It seemed that they
made their living in this way, clamming, as they
called it, all the way from Arkansas to the upper
waters of the Mississippi. They had made this
side expedition up a tributary, in search of country
not so thoroughly exploited; without much success
in their venture, it seemed. The old lady, her head
wrapped in a dirty shawl, sat down on an empty
box, and stroked a large and dirty Angora cat,
another member of the family, the while she bitterly
and profanely complained. It was now dusk,
and she did not notice anything out of the way
in her son&rsquo;s rather swollen nose and lips.</p>

<p>I explained to Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
were now come into the neighborhood of possible
treasure, and the sight of a few pearls, none of
very great worth, which the old crone produced
from a cracker box, was enough to set off Jimmy
L&rsquo;Olonnois, who was all for raiding the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he hissed to me in an aside. &ldquo;Did
we not spare his life? Then the treasure should
be ours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, brother,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We shall see what
we shall see.&rdquo; And I quieted Lafitte also, who
was war-like at the very sound of the word pearl.
&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s what they take from the Spanish ships,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Pearls is fitten for ladies fair. An&rsquo; here
is pearls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, brother,&rdquo; I demanded of him. For I
was revolving something in my mind. I presently
accosted the clammers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you say business is bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly and shorely is,&rdquo; assented the old
dame, fishing a black pipe out of her pocket, and
proceeding to feed it from another pocket, to the
discomfort of the soiled Angora cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, let me make you a proposition,&rdquo;
said I, taking a glance at the heap of fresh shell
which lay beyond the racks of trolling lines and
their twisted wire hooks, by means of which
dragging apparatus the mussels are taken&mdash;shutting
hard on the wire when it touches them as they lie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
feeding with open mouths&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve quite a lot of
shell there, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what&rsquo;s in it? Button factories all
shut down with a strike, and no market: and as
for pearls, they ain&rsquo;t none. Blame me for carryin&rsquo;
a grouch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. But what will you take for
your shells, and agree to open them for us, at
wages of five dollars a day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of us?&rdquo; he demanded shrewdly. I smiled
and nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than you average, twice
over,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and you say the stream is no good.
Now I, too, am a student of the great law of
averages, because I am or was a director in a
great life insurance company. You say the luck
is bad. Like other adventurers, I say that under
the law of averages, it is time for the luck to
change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The luck&rsquo;s with you,&rdquo; growled the clammer,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s ag&rsquo;in me.&rdquo; Unconsciously, he put a finger to
his swollen nose. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you gimme?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hundred dollars bonus and ten dollars a
day,&rdquo; said I promptly; and he seemed to know I
would not better that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo; he queried: &ldquo;a buyer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, a pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe ye. I never saw such a outfit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
&ldquo;Will you trade?&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;and how long will
it take to open the lot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nigh all day, even if we set up all night and
roasted.&rdquo; He nodded to a wide grating; and the
ashes underneath showed that in this way the poor
clams, like the Incas of old, were sometimes forced
to give up their treasures by the persuasion of a
fire under them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it a day.
That&rsquo;s a hundred and ten dollars for you by this
time to-morrow. I invoke the aid of capital and
of chance, both, against you. You will very likely
lose: but if so, it would not be the first time
the producer of wealth has lost it. But I make
the wager fair, as my reason tells me I should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a crazy bunch, and I think ye&rsquo;re out of
the state asylum over yonder,&rdquo; broke in the old
woman, &ldquo;but what the hell do we care whether
ye&rsquo;re crazy or not? Ye look like ye had the money.
Jake, we&rsquo;ll take him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jake. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning, then,&rdquo; said I; and our
party rose to return to our camp, where Partial
greeted us with warmth; he having assigned to
himself the duty of guard. And so, as Pepys
would say, to bed; although Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois
scarce could sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him attempt to make a run for it, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
we have hove him to, and we will board him and
give no quarter!&rdquo; This was almost the last of
the direful speech I heard from L&rsquo;Olonnois, as at
last I turned myself to a night of deep and peaceful
slumber.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE TAKE MUCH TREASURE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;Y</span>OU must be awful rich, Black Bart,&rdquo; said
L&rsquo;Olonnois to me as we sat on the grass,
at breakfast, the following morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jimmy,&rdquo; I replied, putting down my coffee
cup, &ldquo;on the contrary, I am very poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have all sorts of things, back there
where you live; and last night you said you would
pay that man a hundred dollars, just to open a
lot of clam shells. Now, a hundred dollars is a
awful sight of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends, Jimmy,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; we&rsquo;d ought to <em>take</em> them pearls,&rdquo; broke in
Lafitte. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we lick him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did, yes; twice.&rdquo; And in my assent I felt,
again, a fierce satisfaction in the first conquest of
our invader, that of body to body, eye to eye;
rather than in the one where I brought intellect
to aid in war. &ldquo;But there are two ways of being
a pirate. Let us see if we can not win treasure
by taking a chance in logic, and so be modern
pirates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not understand me, and went mute,
but at last Jimmy resumed his catechism. &ldquo;Who
owns the place where you live, Black Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some five or six miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! That must be over a hundred acres. I
didn&rsquo;t know anybody owned that much land.
Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In part from my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business was he in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a pirate, Jimmy, or at least, they said
he was. But my mother was not.&mdash;I will tell
you,&rdquo; I added suddenly: &ldquo;my father owned a great
deal of timber land long ago, and iron, and oil,
and copper, when nobody cared much for them.
They say, now, he stole some of them, I don&rsquo;t
know. In those days people weren&rsquo;t so particular.
The more he got, the more he wanted. He never
was a boy like you and me. He educated me as
a lawyer, so that I could take care of his business
and his property, and he trained me in the pirate
business the best he could, and I made money too,
all I wanted. You see, my father could never get
enough, but I did; perhaps, because my mother
wasn&rsquo;t a pirate, you see. So, when I got enough,
my father and mother both died, and when I began
to see that, maybe, my father had taken a little
more than our share, I began trying to do something
for people ... but I can&rsquo;t talk about that,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; demanded Lafitte. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellow doesn&rsquo;t like to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little. I found I could not do very much.
I gave some buildings to schools, that sort of
thing. No one thanked me much. A good many
called me a Socialist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&mdash;a Socialist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. Nobody knows. But really,
I suppose, a Socialist is a man born before the
world got used to steam and electricity. Those
things made a lot of changes, you see, and in the
confusion some people didn&rsquo;t get quite as square
a deal as they deserved; or at least, they didn&rsquo;t
think they had. It takes time, really, as I suppose,
to settle down after any great change. It&rsquo;s
like moving a house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jimmy sagely. &ldquo;But, Black Bart,
you always seemed to me like as if, now, well,
like you was studyin&rsquo; or something, somehow.
Ain&rsquo;t you never had no good times before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. This is about the first really good time
I ever had in all my life. You see, you can&rsquo;t really
understand things that you look at from a long
way off&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to get right in with folks to
know what folks are. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; answered Jimmy, with conviction.
And I recalled, though he did not, the fact that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
he bathed daily, Lafitte weekly, yet no gulf was
fixed between their portions of the general humanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be nice to be rich,&rdquo; ventured Lafitte
presently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be, some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that why you go a-pirating?&rdquo; I smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But mostly, because I like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of game,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All life is a sort of game, my hearties,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;What you two just have said covers most of
the noble trade of piracy and nearly all of the
pretty game of life. You are wise as I am, wise
as any man, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I like about you, Black Bart,&rdquo; resumed
L&rsquo;Olonnois, naively, &ldquo;is, you seem always fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I flushed at this, suddenly, and pushed back my
plate. &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;I would rather
have heard that, from you, than to hear I had
made a million dollars from pearls or anything
else. For that has always been my great hope
and wish&mdash;that some day I could teach myself
always to be fair&mdash;not to deceive anybody, most
of all not myself; in short, to be fair. Brother,
I thank you, if you really believe I have succeeded
to some extent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t you always jolly, like you was havin&rsquo;
a good time, then?&rdquo; demanded my blue-eyed inquisitor.
&ldquo;Honor bright!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
&ldquo;Must it be honor bright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell you. It is because of the first
chapter of Genesis, Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie! Fie! Jimmy, haven&rsquo;t you read that?&rdquo;
He shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a little about the fights,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;when Saul &rsquo;n&rsquo; David &rsquo;n&rsquo; a lot of &rsquo;em slew them
tens of thousands. But Genesis was dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember any place where it says
&lsquo;Male and female created He them&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; but what of it? That&rsquo;s dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it, though?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;And you with
an Auntie Helena, and a brother Black Bart. Jimmy
L&rsquo;Olonnois, little do you know what you say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; interrupted the ruthless soul of
Jean Lafitte, &ldquo;how about them pearls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented Jimmy. &ldquo;Pearls is booty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, shipmates,&rdquo; I assented, &ldquo;as
soon as we have washed the dishes, we will see
what can be done with the enemy yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found our two clammers, the young man
and his crone of a mother, up betimes and hard
at work, as evil-looking a pair as ever I saw. The
man&rsquo;s face was still puffed and discolored, where
my fists had punished him, and his disposition had
not improved overnight. His hag-like dam also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
regarded us with suspicion and disfavor, I could
note, and I saw her glance from me to her son,
making mental comparisons; and guessed she had
heard explanations regarding black eyes which did
not wholly satisfy her.</p>

<p>They had already roasted open and examined
quite a heap of shells by the time we arrived, and
I inquired, pleasantly, if they had found anything.
The man answered surlily that they had not; but
something made me feel suspicious, since they
had made so early a start. I saw him now and
then wipe his hands on his overalls, and several
times noted that as he did so, his middle finger
projected down below the others, as though he
were touching for something inside his pocket,
which lay in front, the overalls being made for a
carpenter, with a narrow pocket devised for carrying
a folded foot-rule. But I could see nothing
suggested in the pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; I said pleasantly. &ldquo;It looks
as though I were going to lose my hundred, doesn&rsquo;t
it? Still, the day is long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I busied myself in watching the deft work of
the two as they opened the shells started by the
heat, sweeping out the fetid contents, and feeling
in one swift motion of a thumb for any hidden
secretion of the nacre. Nothing was found while
I was watching, and as I did not much like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
odor, I drew to one side. I found L&rsquo;Olonnois and
Lafitte standing apart, in full character, arms
folded and scowling heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If yonder villain plays us false,&rdquo; said Lafitte
between his clenched teeth, &ldquo;he shall feel the vengeance
of Jean Lafitte! And I wouldn&rsquo;t put it a
blame bit a-past him, neither,&rdquo; he added, slightly
out of drawing for the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are well named, Lafitte,&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;You
are a good business man. But the day is long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was, indeed, long, and I put in part of it
wandering about with Partial, hunting for
squirrels, which he took much delight in chasing
up trees. Again, I lay for a time reading one of
my favorite authors, the wise stoic, Epictetus,
tarrying over one of my favorite passages:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember that you are an actor of just such
a part as is assigned you by the Poet of the play;
of a short part, if the part be short, of a long part
if the part be long. Should He wish you to act
the part of a beggar, (&lsquo;or of a pirate,&rsquo; I interpolated,
aloud to myself, and smiling) take care
to act it naturally and nobly; and the same if it
be the part of a lame man, or a ruler, or a private
man. For this is in your power&mdash;to act well the
part assigned to you; but to choose that part is
the function of another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lay thoughtful, querying. Was I a rich man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
or a poor man? Was I a ruler, or a private man,
or a lame man?... I asked myself many questions,
concluding that all my life I had, like most
of us all, been more or less a lame man and a
private man after all, and much like my fellow....
It was a great day for me; since each day I
seek to learn something. And here now was I,
blessed by the printed wisdom of age and philosophy,
and yet more blessed by the spoken philosophy
of unthinking Youth.... I lay flat, my arms
out on the grass, and looked up at the leaves. I
felt myself a part of the eternal changeless
scheme, and was well content. It has always been
impossible for me to care for the little things of
life&mdash;such as the amassing of money&mdash;when I am
alone in the woods. I pondered now on the wisdom
of my teachers, Epictetus, Jimmy, John and
the author of the Book of Genesis.</p>

<p>I arose at last with less of melancholy and more
of resolve than I had known for years. The world
swam true on its axis all around me; and I, who
all my life had been in some way out of balance
in the world, now walked with a strange feeling
of poise and certainty.... No, I said to myself,
I would argue no more with Helena. And meantime
since the Poet of the play had assigned me
the double r&ocirc;le of pirate and boy, I was resolved
to act both &ldquo;naturally and nobly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
I could not have called either of my associates
less than natural and noble in his part, viewed as
I found them when at length I sought them to
partake of a cold luncheon. They stood apart,
gloom and stern dignity themselves, offering no
speech to the laboring clammers, who, by this time,
were but masses of evil odors and ill-temper in
equal parts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; out on us!&rdquo; hissed Jean
Lafitte, as I approached. &ldquo;Time and again I seen
the varlet make false moves. Let him have a
care! The eye of Jean Lafitte is upon him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For my own part, I cared little for anything
beyond the sport in my pearl venture, but no man
likes to be &ldquo;done,&rdquo; so I joined the guard over the
pearl fishing. I could see little indication of success
on the part of the two clammers, who went
on in their work steadily, exchanging no more
than a monosyllable now and then, but who were
animated, it seemed to us, by the same excitement
which governs the miner washing gravel in his
pan. They scarce could rest, but went on from
shell to shell, opening each as eagerly as though
it meant a fortune. This of itself seemed to me
both natural and yet not wholly natural; for it was
now late in the day&rsquo;s work. Why should they go
on quite so eagerly in what six hours of stooping
in the sun should have made monotonous routine?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
They showed me a few pieces they had saved,
splinters and slugs of nacre, misshapen and of no
luster, and sneered at the net results, worth, at
most, not so much as the day&rsquo;s wages I was paying
either. I cared nothing for the results, and
smiled and nodded as I took them.</p>

<p>Thus the day wore on till mid-afternoon, when,
such had been the zeal of the clammers, the heap
of bivalves was exhausted. They stood erect,
straightening their stiffened backs, and grinned as
they looked at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old hag, &ldquo;I reckon ye&rsquo;re satisfied
now that we know this business better&rsquo;n you
do. He told ye there wasn&rsquo;t no pearl in this river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; added her hopeful son, &ldquo;an&rsquo; come to
think of it, how&rsquo;d I ever know you had a hundred
dollars? I ain&rsquo;t seen it yet. But we&rsquo;ve done, so
let&rsquo;s see it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I quietly opened my pocketbook and took several
bills of that yellow-backed denomination, and selected
one for him. He took it at first suspiciously,
then greedily, and I saw his eyes go to my
wallet. &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; said I, and took out two bills
of five dollars each, which I handed to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By golly!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so&rsquo;d I forgot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you forget about your wages?&rdquo; I
asked, and looked at him keenly. He turned his
eyes aside.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
&ldquo;This fresh-water pearl fishing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has
many points of likeness to the ocean pearl fishing
in Ceylon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You been there?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;And why is
it like them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In several ways. It is, in the first place, all
a gamble. The pearl merchants buy the oysters
as I bought my mussels, by the lump and as a
chance, based on the law of average product. They
rot the oysters as you do the mussels. The smell
is the same: and many other things are the same.
For instance, it is almost impossible to keep the
diver from stealing pearls, just as it is hard to
keep the Kafirs from stealing the diamonds they
find in the mines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I still was looking at him closely, and now I
said to him mildly, and in a low tone of voice,
&ldquo;It would be of no use&mdash;I should only beat you
again; and I would rather spare your mother.
You see,&rdquo; I added in a louder tone of voice, &ldquo;the
natives put pearls in their hair, between their toes,
in their mouths&mdash;although they do not chew tobacco
as you do. One who merely put one in the
pocket of his overalls&mdash;if he wore overalls&mdash;would
be called very clumsy, indeed, especially if he had
been seen to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Involuntarily, he clapped a hand on his pocket.
What would have been his next act I do not know,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
for at that moment I heard a voice call out sharply,
&ldquo;Halt! villain. Throw up your hands, or by
heavens you die!&rdquo; Turning swiftly, I saw Lafitte,
his pistol barrel rested in very serviceable fashion
in the crotch of a staff, the same as when he first
accosted me on my stream, glancing along the
barrel with an ominous gray eye again gone three-cornered.</p>

<p>Before I could even cry out to him his warning
was effective. I saw my clam fisher go white
and put his hands over his head, the while his
dam ran screaming toward the tent&mdash;Jimmy
L&rsquo;Olonnois at her heels, sword in hand, and warning
her not to get a gun, else her life&rsquo;s blood would
dye the strand.</p>

<p>Here, now, was a pretty pickle for a sworn servant
of the law to aid in making! A wrong move
might mean murder done by these imaginative
youths, and I no less than accessory, to boot; for,
surely, I had given them aid and violent counsel
in this drama which we all were playing so naturally,
if not so nobly. I hastened over to Lafitte
and called loudly to L&rsquo;Olonnois, and commanded
Partial to drop the renewed encounter with the
clammers&rsquo; dog, which now, also, swiftly threatened
us. So, in a moment or two, I restored peace.</p>

<p>I held out my hand to the clammer. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you seen me,&rdquo; said he simply; and placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
in my hand three pearls, either of them worth
more than all I had paid him, and one of them the
largest and best I had ever seen&mdash;it is the pearl
famous as the &ldquo;<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>,&rdquo; the finest ever taken
in fresh waters in America, so it is said by
Tiffany&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I looked at him quietly, and handed him back
all but the one pearl. &ldquo;I am sorry you were not
a better sport,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;very sorry. Didn&rsquo;t I play
fair with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Some folks have all the luck.
You come along here, rich, with all sorts of things,
you and them d&mdash;&mdash;d kids, and you&rsquo;d rob a man
like me out of what little he can make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was opening my wallet again. &ldquo;I am sorry
to hear you say that,&rdquo; said I, handing him two
bills of a hundred dollars each. &ldquo;Sorry, because
it has cost you twenty-eight hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, man, what do you mean?&rdquo; he gasped,
even his fingers slow to take both money and contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the pearl is worth to me that much, since
I have purpose for it. I have more money than I
want, and fewer pearls like this than I want. It
would have given me the keenest sort of pleasure
to give you and your mother a few thousand dollars,
two or three, to set you up with a little
launch and an outfit enough to give you a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
start&mdash;and, perhaps, a good partner. As it is, you
are lucky my pirate brother has not blown a hole
through you, and that my other brother has not
shed the blood of your parent, if she have any.
You had a good chance, and like many another
man who isn&rsquo;t good enough to deserve success,
you lost it. Do you know why you failed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the luck,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I never had none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is not that. So far as luck
goes, you are lucky you are alive. Little do you
know our desperate band. Little do you know
you have escaped the wrath of Lafitte, of L&rsquo;Olonnois,
of Black Bart. Luck! No, that is not why
you failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; he demanded, still covetous, albeit
rueful, too, at what he vaguely knew was lost
opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was because you did not play the part of
a clammer naturally and nobly,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;My
friend, I counsel you to read Epictetus&mdash;and while
you are at that,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I suggest you read also
that other classic, the one known as <i>The Pirate&rsquo;s
Own Book</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, since he stood stupefied, and really
not seeing my hand, which I reached out to him
in farewell, I called to Partial, and followed by
the two stern and relentless figures, made our way
back to the spot where the good ship <i>Sea Rover</i>
lay straining at her hawser.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
&ldquo;What ho! messmates!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Fortune has
been kind to our bold band this day. We have
taken large booty. Let us up anchor and set sail.
Before yon sun has sunk into the deep we shall
be far away, and our swift craft is able to shake
off all pursuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither away, Black Bart,&mdash;Captain, I mean!&rdquo;
said Jean Lafitte (and I blushed at this title and
this hard-won rank, as one of the proudest of my
swiftly-following accomplishments in happiness).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spang! to the Spanish Main,&rdquo; was my reply.</p>

<p>A moment later, the waves were rippling merrily
along the sides of the <i>Sea Rover</i> as she headed
out boldly into the high seas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I SHOW MY TRUE COLORS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE were many lesser adventures in which
Lafitte, L&rsquo;Olonnois and I shared on our voyage
through the long waterways leading down to
the great river, but of these I make small mention,
for, in truth, one boasts little of one&rsquo;s deeds in
piracy after the fact, or of inciting piracy and
making accessories before the fact, the more especially
if such accessories be small but bloodthirsty
boys. These latter, let me plead in extenuation
of my own sins, already were pirates, and
set upon rapine. For my own part, seeing their
resolution to take green corn and other vegetables,
aye, even fowls, as part of the natural returns of
their stern calling, I made no remonstrances, not
the first leader unable to restrain his ruthless band,
but I eased my own conscience by leaving&mdash;quite
unknown to them,&mdash;sundry silver coins in cleft
sticks, prominently displayed, in the hope that
irate farmers might find them when, after our
departure, they visited the scenes of our marauding.
And to such an extent did this marauding
obtain that, by the time we had reached the Mississippi
River, I was almost wholly barren of further
silver coins.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
Many things I learned as we voyaged; as that
my dog Partial would, when asked, roll over and
over upon the ground, or sit up and bark&mdash;things
taught him by no man known in his history, so
far as Lafitte could recall it. And things I learned
regarding birds and small animals of which my
law books had told me nothing. As to mosquitoes,
I learned that, whereas they do not hurt a young
pirate, they do an old one; and I half resolved to
discontinue my book regarding them. Perhaps it
was not of first importance.</p>

<p>But two things grew on me in conviction. First,
I loved Helena Emory more and more each day of
my life; and second, that I must see her at the first
moment possible&mdash;in spite of all my resolutions
to put her out of my life forever! And, these two
things being assured, when we saw the rolling
yellowish flood of the Father of the Waters at
last sweeping before us, I realized that, bound as
I was in honor to hold on with my faithful band,
our craft, the <i>Sea Rover</i>&mdash;sixteen feet long she
was, and well equipped with Long Toms and deck
cannonades&mdash;would have no chance to overtake
the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, fastest yacht on the Great Lakes,
who might, so far as I could tell, at that very
moment be cleaving through the Chicago canal,
to enter the great river hundreds of miles ahead
of us.</p>

<p>Wherefore, leaving my bold mates in bivouac
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
one day, I made journey to the nearest town.
There, I sent certain messages to anxious parents,
and left for them our probable itinerary as tourists
traveling by private conveyance. I could not
set our future dates and ports more closely together;
for, before I left town, I had purchased
a sturdy power boat of our own, capable of doing
her ten or twelve miles under her own petrol. I
was in no mind to fall farther and farther back
of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> each day; and I counted upon
our piratical energy to keep us going more hours
a day than Cal Davidson&mdash;curses on him!&mdash;would
be apt to travel.</p>

<p>I gave orders for immediate fitting of my new
craft, and delivery on the spot; and within the
hour, although regarded with much suspicion by
the town marshal and many leading citizens, I
set out for our bivouac, with the aid of the late
owner of the boat, to whom I gave assurance that
no evil should befall him. When we chugged
along the shore, and slackened opposite our camp,
I heard the stern voice of Lafitte hail us: &ldquo;Ship
ahoy!&rdquo; (Perhaps he saw me at the stern sheets.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye! Aye! mate!&rdquo; I answered, through my
cupped hands. &ldquo;Bear a hand with our landing
line.&rdquo; Whereat my hardy band came running
and made us fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has gone wrong, Black Bart?&rdquo; demanded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
L&rsquo;Olonnois, uncertain of my status. &ldquo;Hast met
mishap and struck colors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means!&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;This is a prize,
our first capture. And since she has struck her
colors, let us mount our own at her foremast and
ship our band to a bigger and faster craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The late owner, who bore the name of Robinson,
looked on much perplexed, and, I think, in
some apprehension, for he must have thought us
dangerous, whether sane or mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll run her?&rdquo; he at length demanded of
me, looking from me to my two associates. Then
forth and stood Jean Lafitte; and answered a question
I confess I had not yet myself asked: &ldquo;Ho!
I guess a fellow who can run a gasoline pump in
a creamery can handle one of them things. So
think not, fellow, to escape us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I reassured Robinson, who was apparently ready
to make a run for it; and I explained to Lafitte
and L&rsquo;Olonnois my plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll by no means discard our brig, the original
<i>Sea Rover</i>,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll tow her along
as our tender. But we&rsquo;ll christen the prize the
<i>Sea Rover</i> instead, and hoist our flag over her&mdash;and
paint on her name at the first point of call we
make. Now, let us hasten, for two thousand miles
of sea lie before us, and Robinson is also five
miles from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
But Robinson became more and more alarmed
each moment. He had my money, I his bill of
sale, but ride back to town with us he would not.
Instead, he washed his hands of us and started
back afoot&mdash;to get the town marshal, I was well
convinced. It mattered little to us; for once more
did sturdy Jean Lafitte more than make good his
boast. With one look at the gasoline tank to assure
himself that all was well, he made fast the
painter of the old <i>Sea Rover</i>, and even as L&rsquo;Olonnois
with grim determination planted the Jolly
Rover above our bows, and as I tossed aboard the
cargo of our former craft, Lafitte cranked her up
with master hand, threw in the gear, and with a
steady eye headed her for midstream, where town
marshals may not come.</p>

<p>I looked at my mates in admiration. They
could do things I could not do, and they faced
the future with no trace of hesitation. I caught
from them a part of this resolution I so long had
lacked. I added this to my determination to see
Helena Emory once more and soon as wind and
wave would allow. So that, believe me, the blood
rose quickly in my veins as I saw now we had
faster travel ahead of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Square away the main braces, my hearties!&rdquo;
I called. &ldquo;Break out the spinnaker and set the
jibs. It&rsquo;s a wet sheet and a flowing sea, and let
any stop us at their peril!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
&ldquo;Aye! Aye! Sir,&rdquo; came the response of Jean Lafitte
in a voice almost bass, and &ldquo;Aye! Aye! Sir,&rdquo;
piped the blue-eyed Lieutenant L&rsquo;Olonnois. The
stanch craft leaped ahead, wallowing in cross
seas till we reached the mid-current of the Mississippi&rsquo;s
heavy flood, then riding and rising gamely
as she met wave after wave that came up-stream
with the head wind. The eyes of Lafitte gleamed.
L&rsquo;Olonnois, hand over eyes, stood in our bows.
&ldquo;Four bells, and all&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; he intoned in a vigorous
voice.</p>

<p>It was my own heart made answer, in the sweetest
challenge it ever had given to the world: &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
well!&rdquo; And far ahead I, too, peered across the
wave, seeking to make out the hull of fleeing craft
that bore treasure I was resolved should yet be
mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More sail, Officer!&rdquo; I called to Jean Lafitte.
He grinned in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a hurry, Black Bart. What makes
you?&rdquo; And even L&rsquo;Olonnois turned a searching
gaze upon me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll show you my true colors,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;I am more careless of taking treasure than of
capturing a certain maiden who flees before us
yonder on a swift craft, speedier than our own.
Lay me alongside of her, this week, next month,
this winter, and my share of the other booty shall
be yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
&ldquo;Black Bart,&rdquo; said Lafitte, &ldquo;I knew something
was sort of botherin&rsquo; you. So, it&rsquo;s you for the fair
captive, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH MY PLOT THICKENS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E sped on now steadily, day by delightful day,
and ever arose in my soul new wonders
at the joy of life itself, things that had escaped
me in my plodding business life. Now and again,
I took from my pocket the little volume which
always went with me on the stream when I angled,
and which I confess sometimes charmed me away
from the stream to some shaded nook where I
might read old Omar undisturbed&mdash;as now I
might, with L&rsquo;Olonnois at the masthead and Lafitte
at the wheel. And always these wise, reckless,
joyous pages of the old philosopher spelled
to me &ldquo;Haste! Haste!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Whether at Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r or Babylon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bird of Time has but a little way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flutter&mdash;and the Bird is on the Wing!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>What truth, what absolute truth of the red-hot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
spur lay in those words, lesson direst to me! What
had my life been, plodding in books to learn to
keep by forms of law the booty my father had
stolen? Away with it, then, for now the Bird
of Time was on the wing! Let me forget the
wasted years, spent in adding dollar to dollar;
for what could the highest pile of dollars mean
to a man who had missed what Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois
and Omar had in their teaching? The booty
of the world, the pearls of price, the casks of the
Wine of Life, are his only who takes them. They
can not be bought, can not be given. &ldquo;Oh, haste!
Jean Lafitte, for my new knowledge indeed eats
at my soul. Hasten, for the Bird of Life is on
the wing, L&rsquo;Olonnois.&rdquo; So I spoke to them; and
they, feeling it all a part of the play, gravely answered
in kind, to what end that any who sought
to stay Black Bart and his crew did so at peril
of their blood.</p>

<p>We came, I knew not after how many days forgotten
in detail&mdash;after passing, each avoided as a
pestilence, many cities prosperous in commerce&mdash;alongside
the river port of the city of St. Louis,
crowded with motley and misfit shipping of one
sort or other, where our craft might moor without
fear of exciting any suspicion, in spite of our
ominous name; for I had the precaution to lower
our flag of the skull and cross-bones.</p>

<p>I sought out the man most apt to know of any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
considerable vessels docking there, and made inquiry
for any power yacht one hundred and
twenty-five feet long, white and black ventilators,
white hull with blue line, flying the burgee <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i>, or some such name. None could advise
me for a time, and I looked in vain, as I had in
every dock in six hundred miles, for the trim hull
of my yacht. At last one old mariner, in rubber
boots, himself skipper of a house-boat south-bound
for a winter&rsquo;s trapping, admitted that he had seen
such a craft three days before!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she dock?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure she did, and lay over night. I remember
it well enough, for I saw her tie up; and that
evening her owner went ashore and up-town, and
with him his bride, I reckon&mdash;handsomest girl in
all the town. They must have been married, for
he was lookin&rsquo; like he owned her. That was
lemme see, two days ago or maybe four. They
came aboard her next morning, all three&mdash;there
was a old party along, girl&rsquo;s mother likely&mdash;around
eleven o&rsquo;clock, and in a little while cast off and
went on down-river. As fine a boat as ever made
the river run&mdash;still as a mouse she was, but quick
as a cat, and around Ste. Genevieve, I reckon,
before I got back to my own scow after helping
them off here. No wonder her owner was proud.
He stood on the quarter-deck like a lord. Why
shouldn&rsquo;t he, ownin&rsquo; a boat an&rsquo; a girl like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t own either!&rdquo; I retorted hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you know he don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; demanded
my sea-going man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who should know, if not myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho! You talk like you owned her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do own her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like it. Which do you mean&mdash;her the
yacht, or her the girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both&mdash;no! That is, well at least I own the
boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may all be, or it all mayn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied,
openly scoffing; &ldquo;at least so far&rsquo;s the boat goes.
Anybody kin buy anything that has the price. But
as to the girl, you&rsquo;d have to prove it, if I was him.
And if he didn&rsquo;t look like he owned her, or was
goin&rsquo; to, I&rsquo;ll eat your own gas tank there, an&rsquo; them
two kids in it fer good measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I could not argue or explain, and therefore
turned away. But all the answer of my soul
came from the lips of L&rsquo;Olonnois, who, propped
up against the cockpit combing, was reading aloud
to Lafitte from <i>The Pirate&rsquo;s Own Book</i> as I approached.
&ldquo;Hah! my good man!&rdquo; exclaimed the
pirate chieftain as he looked at his blade, &ldquo;unhand
the maid, or by Heaven! your life&rsquo;s blood shall
dye the deck where you stand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha! Cal Davidson,&rdquo; said I to myself
through my set teeth; &ldquo;little do you think that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
you are discovered in your sins, and little do you
know that the avenger is on your track. But have
a care, for Black Bart and his band pursues you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, seeing that we had now laid in abundance
of ship&rsquo;s stores, including four drums of gasoline;
and since the trail of Cal Davidson was, at least,
no wider than the banks of the river down which
he had fled, it looked ill enough for the chances
of that robber when the stanch <i>Sea Rover</i>, her
flag again aloft and promising no quarter, chugged
out into midstream and took up a pursuit which
was to know no faltering until at last I had learned
the truth about the fair captive of the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i>. For indeed, indeed, Omar, and you, too,
stout Lafitte and hardy L&rsquo;Olonnois, the Bird of
Life was on the wing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE CLOSE WITH THE ENEMY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>AL Davidson took on five drums of petrol at
Cairo, and a like amount of champagne at
Memphis, and no man may tell what other supplies
at this or that other point along the river. He evidently
suspected no pursuit, or, if he did, was a
swaggering varlet enough, for, according to all
accounts which we could get, he loitered and
lingered along, altogether at his leisure, with due
attention to social matters at every port; for if
he had not a wife at every port, at least, he had
an acquaintance of business or social sort, so that,
one might be sure, there were few dull moments
for him and his party, whether afloat or ashore.
He must have attended a dinner-party and two
theaters at Memphis, and have sailed only after
making three thousand dollars out of a combination
in champagne present and cotton future,
whose disgusting details I did not seek to learn.
Trust Davidson to make money, and to make the
most of life also as he went along. He
always had the best of everything; and surely now
he had, for the leisurely, ease-seeking <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>,
not actuated by any vast motive beyond that of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
the bee and the honey flower, slipped on down
and ahead with perfect ease, while we, grimy,
slow, determined, plowed on in her wake losing
miles each hour the graceful <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> chose
to show us her light disdainful heels, serenely
indifferent because wholly ignorant of our existence.</p>

<p>But we held to the chase as true pirates, not
loitering at any port, and&mdash;since now I, also, had
learned something of the intricacies of our engine,
and could take a trick while the others slept&mdash;running
twice the hours daily the haughty yacht
would deign to log. I knew that Cal Davidson
would stop to shoot and to visit, and knew that
he could, by no human means, be induced to pass
any telegraph point where the daily standing of
the baseball clubs could be learned&mdash;he counted
that day lost in which he did not learn the scores.
As for myself, I have never been able to understand
how any grown man or any one ungrown
can take any interest whatever in the deeds of
hired ball-playing Hessians, who have back of them
neither patriotism nor even a municipal pride. But,
for once, I was joyed that the organized business
sense of a few men had put an otherwise able citizen
under tribute, because now, though the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i> must pause at least daily, the <i>Sea Rover</i>
need do no such thing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
Nor did we. We were hot on the trail of the
enemy as he flew south along the Chickasha Bluffs,
hot as he left Memphis behind, and taking the
widening waters which now wandered through
low forest lands, reached out for the next city of
size, historic Vicksburg on her seventy hills. And
hot and eager, more than ever, were we when,
chugging around the head of that vast arm of
the river, where it curves like a boy of some
southern sea, with its heights rising beyond and
afar, we saw what caused me to exclaim aloud,
&ldquo;At last! There she lies, my hearties!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pointed on ahead. To my eyes, who had designed
her, every line of that long, graceful, white
hull was familiar. The jaunty rake of her air-shafts,
like stacks of a liner, the sweep of her clean
freeboard up to her shining rail, the ease of her
bows, the graceful boldness of her overhang&mdash;all
were familiar enough to me. She was my boat,
and once I was wont to enjoy her. And on board
her now was the woman who had taken away from
me all desire to keep a yacht in commission, to
keep open a house in town, or an office, or to frequent
my clubs, or to meet my friends. Was she
there, this woman; and was she still?&mdash;but I dared
not ask that question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead, Jean!&rdquo; I called. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>! Yonder lies the enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
And then the inevitable happened. Perhaps it
was too much gas, perhaps too much lubricant,
perhaps a spark plug was carrying too much carbon.
At any rate, the engine of the <i>Sea Rover</i>
chose that time to chug and cease to revolve!</p>

<p>It was more than a mile to the foot of that
vast curve; and even as I leaped at the grimy
oily motor, I saw a white dingey with blue trim
make out from the wharf and leisurely pull alongside
the landing stair of the yacht. It held two
figures only, that of the deck-hand who rowed,
and that of the large white-flanneled man who
now disembarked from the dingey and went
aboard the yacht. He was waving a paper over
his head, so that I inferred the Giants must have
won that day. And then, as we tugged and hurried
with our arbitrary motor, I saw the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i>, with a slight smiling salute to friends
ashore, swing daintily about and head out and
down the river! The faint and infallible rhythm of
her perfect enginery came throbbing to us across
the water ... I stood up. I hailed, I waved, I
shouted, and I fear even cursed. Perhaps they
thought some drunken fisherman was disporting
himself; but certainly, a few moments later, we
were rocking on the roll of the river, and the yacht
was out of sight and sound around the next great
bend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
&ldquo;It shall go hard but we overhaul yon varlet
yet,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; assented Lafitte; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve busted a plug,
an&rsquo; he has showed us a clean pair of heels, but
it&rsquo;s a long chase if the <i>Sea Rover</i> does not overhaul
him. We&rsquo;ll have to overhaul our engine
first, though,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>But the overhauling of our engine meant a
voyage under sweeps to a precarious landing
among divers packets, house-boats and launches, on
Vicksburg waterside, and a later visit to a specialist
in diseases of the carburetor; so that, when at
last the <i>Sea Rover</i> was ready for the sea again,
her chase might have been a hundred miles ahead
an she liked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean Lafitte, as we were about
to cast off. &ldquo;Looky here, de Cubs licked de G&rsquo;ints
five to one to-day.&rdquo; He pointed to figures in a
newspaper which he had obtained. So then it
might have been excitement of rage, and not of
joy, which had animated Cal Davidson when he
went aboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for that gives us
a day&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Jean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that yonder varlet will not leave Natchez
to-morrow until late evening, after the wires
are in from the northern ball games,&rdquo; I replied.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll stop there next.&rdquo; I felt now that
the Lord had, by implanting this insane lust of
petty baseball news in his soul, delivered my enemy
into my hand.</p>

<p>Now I wist not how or at what dignified speed
the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> swept on down that mighty
river through the rich southern lands; nor do I
scarce half remember the painstaking persistent
run we made with the grimy <i>Sea Rover</i> in pursuit,
hour after hour, night or day. We had no
licensed pilot or licensed engineer, we bore no
lights as prescribed by law, and heeded no channels
as prescribed by government engineers.
Pirates, indeed, we might have been as we plowed
on down in the wake of our quarry, along the
ancient highway famous in fast packet days. We
cared nothing for law, order, custom, conventions,
precedents&mdash;the very things which had enslaved me
all my life I now cast aside. Through bend
after bend, along willow-lined flats and bluffs
crowned with stately, moss-draped live-oaks, we
swept on and on; and always I strained my eyes
to see, my ears to hear, on ahead some sign of
the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>; always strained my heart for
some sign from her. Why, even I looked in the
water for some bottle bearing a memory from yon
captive maid to me. Captive? Why, certainly
she must be captive; and certainly she must know
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
that I, Black Bart the Avenger, was upon the
trail.</p>

<p>We made the pleasant city of Natchez in the
evening of the sweetest day on which, as I thought,
the sun had ever set. Her lofty hills&mdash;for here
the great eastern fence of hills which bound the
Vermont Delta on the eastward sweep in to close
the foot of the Delta&rsquo;s V, and run sheer to the
river&rsquo;s brink&mdash;rose upon our left. The low tree-covered
lands on the Louisiana side lay at our
right, and over them hung, center of a most radiant
evening curtain, painted in a thousand colors
by the mighty brush of nature, the round red orb
of day, now sinking to his rest.</p>

<p>I did not begrudge the sun his rest that day.
For now, just at the edge of this beautiful picture
there hung, at the dry point where the old keel
boats used to land at old Natchez, under the hill
where the pirates of those days sought relaxation
from labors in the joys of combat or of wine, I
caught sight of the long, low, graceful hull of
the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast! Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Shorten all
sail, and bear across, west-by-west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye! Aye! Sir,&rdquo; came the response from my
bold crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we run in and board her?&rdquo; demanded
L&rsquo;Olonnois. However, seeing that I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
laid hold of the steering line where I sat, and was
heading the <i>Sea Rover</i> across the Louisiana side,
away from the city&rsquo;s water-front, he subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cast anchor yonder where the holding
ground is good,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;To-night we&rsquo;ll send
off the long boat with a boarding party. And
marry!&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;it shall go hard, but we&rsquo;ll hold
yon varlet to his accounting!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE BOARD THE ENEMY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>LOWLY the vast painting of the sky softened
and faded until, at length, its edges blended
with the shadows of the forest. There came into
relief against the sky-line the etched outlines of
the trees crowning the bluff on the eastern side
of the great river. The oncoming darkness promised
safety for a craft unimportant as ours as
we now lay in the shadows of the western shore.
Meantime, as well as the failing light allowed, we
let nothing on board the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> go unobserved.</p>

<p>The yacht lay&mdash;with an audacity of carelessness
which I did not like to note&mdash;hardly inside the
edge of the regular shipping channel, but swung
securely and gracefully at her cable, held by an
anchor which I had devised myself, heavy enough
for twice her tonnage. On the deck I could see
an occasional figure, but though I plied my binoculars
carefully, not the figure which I sought. A
man leaned against the rail, idly, smoking, but
this I made out to be the engineer, Williams, come
up to get the evening air. Billy, the deck-hand,
John, my Chinese cook, and Peterson, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
boat-master, were at the time out of sight, as well as
Cal Davidson, who had her under charter.</p>

<p>We lay thus, separated by some distance of the
river&rsquo;s flood, each craft at anchor, only one observed
by the other. But to my impatient gaze
matters seemed strangely slow on board the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i>. I was relieved when at last the rather
portly but well groomed figure of my friend Davidson
appeared on deck. He made his way aft
along the rail, and I could see him bend over and
call down the companionway of the after staterooms.
Then, an instant later, he was joined on
the after deck by two ladies. The sight of one
of these caused my heart to bound.</p>

<p>They stood for a moment, no more than dimly
outlined, but I could see them well enough. The
older lady, with the scarf about her head, was
Aunt Lucinda. The slighter figure in white and
wearing no head covering, was she, Helena Emory!
It was Helena! It was Helena!</p>

<p>She turned toward Davidson. I could hear
across the water the sound of laughter. A sudden
feeling of anger came into my soul. I shifted
my position in the <i>Sea Rover</i>, and stepped on Partial&rsquo;s
tail, causing him to give a sharp bark and to
come and lick my hand in swift repentance. I
feared for the time that his sound might attract
attention to our boat, which, if examined closely,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
might seem a trifle suspicious. True pirates, and
oblivious of all law, we had not yet hoisted our
riding lights, though for all I know our black flag
still was flying.</p>

<p>The three figures passed forward along the
deck slowly and disappeared down the front companion-stair
which led to the cozy dining-room. I
could see them all sitting there, about my own
table, using the very silver and linen which I had
had made for the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, attended by John,
my Chinese cook and factotum, whom I had especially
imported, selected from among a thousand
other Chinese by myself at Hankow. I knew that
Davidson would have champagne and a dozen
other wines in abundance, everything the market
offered. A pleasant party, this of three, which was
seating itself at my table over yonder, while I, in
a grimy, dingy, little tub lay looking at them, helpless
in the gloom! Ah, villain, shrewd enough you
were when you planned this trip for Aunt
Lucinda&rsquo;s health! Well enough you knew that
of all places in the world none equals a well
equipped private yacht for the courting of a maid.
Why, if it be propinquity that does it, what chance
had any man on earth against this man, enjoying
the privilege of propinquity of propinquities, and
adding thereto the weapons of every courtesy, every
little pleasure a man may show a maid? Trust
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
Cal Davidson for all that! I well-nigh gnashed
my teeth in anger.</p>

<p>I scarce know how the time passed, until at last
I saw them, in the illumination of the deck lights,
at length come on deck again. They stood looking
out over the river, or toward the lights of Natchez-under-the-Hill,
and at length idly walked aft once
more. The two ladies seated themselves on deck
chairs under the awning of the rear deck. I could
not see them now, but heard the tinkle and throb
of a guitar come across the water, touched lightly
with long pauses, as under some suspended melody
not yet offered in fulness. Now and again I could
hear a word or so, the rather deep voice of Aunt
Lucinda, the bass tones of Davidson, but strain
my ears as I might, I could not hear the sound of
that other voice, low and sweet, an excellent thing
in woman.</p>

<p>At length the little party seemed to be breaking
up. I saw Davidson, half in shadow, outlined
by the deck lights as he rose, and passed forward.
Then I heard the falls run, and a soft splash as
the dingey was launched overside. Cal Davidson
was going ashore. He could no longer resist his
anxiety over the baseball score! A moment later
I heard the dip of the oars. Some one turned
on the search-light, so that a wide shaft of light
swung along the foot of Natchez Hill, toward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
which the dingey was headed. The shadows on
the deck of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> seemed darker now,
by contrast, but I believed that Williams, the engineer,
now had left the rail on which he was leaning
over his folded arms.</p>

<p>I turned now to my wondering companions, who,
seeing me so much interested, had remained for a
long time practically silent. Fall now, curtain of
romance, for we be but three pirates here! Up
anchor, then, and back across the stream toward
our quarry quickly, my bold mates, for now there
lies at hand a dangerous work of the boarding
party!</p>

<p>Thus I might have spoken aloud; for, at least,
I hardly needed to do more than motion to Jean
Lafitte, and as we resumed our softly chugging
progress, having broken out our shallow anchorage,
he steered the boat to the motion of my hand. We
passed close alongside the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> and I examined
her keenly as we did so. Then, apparently
unnoticed, we dropped down-stream a bit, and
found another anchorage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear away the long boat for the boarding
party,&rdquo; I now whispered hoarsely. I spoke to
companions now in full character. Belted and
armed, Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois rose ready for any
bold emprise, each with red kerchief pulled about
his brow. And now, to my interest, I observed that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
each had resumed the black mask which they had
worn earlier in our long voyage, sign of the
desperate character of each wearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither away, Black Bart?&rdquo; demanded L&rsquo;Olonnois
fiercely. &ldquo;Lead, and we follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better put on a mask, Black Bart,&rdquo;
added Jean Lafitte, and handed me a spare one of
his own manufacture. I hesitated, but then, seeing
that part of my success lay in our all remaining
somewhat piratical of character, I hastily slipped
it above my eyes, and pulled down my hat brim.
&ldquo;She will not know me now,&rdquo; said I to myself.
And truly enough we seemed desperate folk, fierce
as any who ever lay in keel boat off the foot of
Natchez bluff, even in the bloodiest times of Mike
Fink the Keel-boatman or of Murrell the southern
bandit king.</p>

<p>Partial, without invitation, climbed into the skiff
with us. &ldquo;Cast off,&rdquo; I ordered. &ldquo;Oars!&rdquo; And
my young men&mdash;whom by this time I had trained
in many ways nautical&mdash;obeyed in good seaman
fashion. A moment later we lay almost under the
rail of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. No one hailed us. We
seemed taken only for some passing skiff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;there is risk in what
we are going to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at my blue-eyed pirate, L&rsquo;Olonnois, who
sat closer to me. On his face was simple and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
complete happiness. At last, his adventure had come
to him and he was meeting it like a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Black Bart?&rdquo; I heard Jean Lafitte
whisper hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are to board and take yonder ship,&rdquo; I replied
softly. &ldquo;If we are to succeed, you must do
precisely as I tell you. Leave the main risk to me,
that of the law. I&rsquo;ll take possession on the ground
that she is my boat, that her charter money is not
paid, and that yonder varlet is making away with
her out of the country. She holds much treasure,
let me assure you of that, my men&mdash;the greatest
treasure that ever came down this river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, listen. You, Lafitte, as soon as we get
aboard, are to run and close the hatch of the engine-room.
That will pen Williams, the engineer,
below, where he can make no resistance. As soon
as that is done, run to those doors forward which
lead down to the dining-room companionway and
shut those doors and latch them. That will take
care of John, the cook. The deck-hand is away
with the varlet. That leaves only the shipmaster
and the women captives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you are busy in this way, Lafitte, I will
hunt for Peterson, the master, who very likely
is sitting quiet on the forward deck somewhere.
The main danger lies with him. While I attend to
him, you, L&rsquo;Olonnois, run aft. You will find there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
two ladies, one very old and ugly, the other very
young and very beautiful. See that they do not
escape, and hold them there until I come aft to
meet you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this must go through as we have planned.
Once the maiden is in our power, and the ship our
own, we will head down-stream for the open sea.
Are you with me, my bold mates?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on, Black Bart!&rdquo; I heard L&rsquo;Olonnois hiss;
and I saw Jean Lafitte tighten his belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready, then,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go forward and
make fast the painter when we reach the landing
stair. Follow me quickly. Leave Partial in the
boat. Gently now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Swiftly but silently, we swept in under the lee
of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. The landing ladder had not
been drawn up after Davidson&rsquo;s departure, so that
the boarding party had easy work ahead.</p>

<p>I sprang upon the deck, my footfalls deadened
by the rubber matting which lay along all the
decks. I turned. Above the rail behind me rose
the face of Lafitte, masked. The long blade of a
Malay kris was in his teeth. In one hand he held a
pistol, using the other as he climbed. He scraped
out of his belt as he came aboard I know not how
many pistols which fell into the water, but still,
God wot! had abundant remaining. Nor did
L&rsquo;Olonnois, close behind him, his Samurai sword
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
between his teeth, present a spectacle less awesome.
I breathed a sudden prayer that these might meet
with no resistance, else I could only fear the direst
consequences!</p>

<p>I made a quick motion with my hand, even as
I sprang forward in search of Peterson. The dull
thud of the engine-room hatch, an instant later,
assured me that Lafitte had performed the most
important part of the work assigned to him. Forsooth,
ere long, he had done all his work as laid
out for him. It chanced that, as he sprang to the
doors of the forward saloon, he met John, the
Chinaman. Reaching for him with one hand, he
closed the doors with the other, with such promptness
and precision that the cue of John was caught
in the door and he was imprisoned below, where he
howled in much grief and perturbation, unable to
escape without the sacrifice of his cue.</p>

<p>Meantime, I found Peterson, my old skipper,
much as I had expected. He was a middle-aged,
placid, well-poised man, a pessimist in speech, but
a bold man in soul. He was fond of an evening
pipe, and he sat now smoking and looking down
the illuminated lane made by our search-light. He
turned toward me, a sudden curiosity upon his
face as he saw that I was a stranger on the boat,
though not a stranger to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;Mr. Harry&mdash;&rdquo; he began, half rising.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
I reached out my left hand and caught him by
the shoulder. In my right hand I held a pistol,
and this, somewhat gaily, I waved before Peterson&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Halt,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or I will blow you
out of the water&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which I had found
sufficient in earlier circumstances.</p>

<p>The old man smiled pleasantly and in mock
fashion put up both his hands. Had it been anyone
else, he probably would have knocked me
down. &ldquo;All right, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will
have your joke. But tell me, what&rsquo;s up? We
weren&rsquo;t expecting you here. Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s gone
ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a lark, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. I had slipped
down the mask so that he could see me plainly.
&ldquo;By George, sir!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am glad to see you,
back on the old boat again. Where have you
been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just come on board, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am
going to run her now myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money not paid over, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. It
stretched my conscience a bit, although the truth
was I had Davidson&rsquo;s uncashed check in my
pocket at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all had our pay regular,&rdquo; he rejoined.
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t had mine, Peterson,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;When the charter money isn&rsquo;t paid and an owner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
has reason to suppose that his boat is going to
be run out of the country, he has to act promptly,
you understand. So I have taken my own way.
The <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> is in my charge now, and you
will report to me for orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that squalling?&rdquo; demanded Peterson,
who was a trifle hard of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something seems wrong with John, the cook,&rdquo;
I answered. &ldquo;I only hope he has not made any
resistance to my men, who, I promise you, are the
most desperate lot that ever cut a throat. For
instance, they have locked Williams down in the
engine-room. Go over there, Peterson, and quiet
him. But tell him that, if he shows a head above
the hatch, he is apt to have his brains blown out.
Keep quiet now, all of you, until I get this thing
in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the boat&rsquo;s under charter to Mr. Davidson,&rdquo;
demurred Peterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charter or no charter, Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in command here, and it&rsquo;s no time to argue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this time we heard cries of a feminine sort
from the after deck, so I knew that L&rsquo;Olonnois, as
well, had performed the duty assigned to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay here, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, and
I&rsquo;ll take care of you in every regard. Wait a
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/tlatp04.jpg" width="375" height="500"
alt="Black Bart, disguised with hat and mask, points a gun at Helena" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded</span>
</div>

<p>I hurried aft. L&rsquo;Olonnois stood in the shadow,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
his back against the saloon door, facing his two
prisoners. I also faced them now. The deck
lights gave ample illumination, so that I could see
her&mdash;Helena&mdash;face to face and fairly. She turned
to me; but now I had pulled up my mask again,
and she could have no more than a suspicion as
to my identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;What right
have you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For half a moment I paused. Then I felt a
sense of relief as I heard at my elbow the piping
voice of L&rsquo;Olonnois in reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, standing with folded arms,
his bared blade gripped in his good right hand and
showing at a short up-cast angle, &ldquo;it ill beseems
a gentleman to give pain to one so fair, but prithee
have a care, for, by heavens! resistance is useless
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS ABOUNDING TROUBLE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> LOOKED at Helena Emory, glad that she did
not at first sight recognize the intruder who
had elicited her wrath,&mdash;for she seemed almost
more angry than perturbed, such being her nature.
I thought she had never been half so beautiful as
now, never more alive, more vibrantly and dynamically
feminine than now. She had not even a
scarf about her head, so that all its Greek clarity
of line, all its tight-curling dark hair&mdash;almost
breaking into four ringlets, two at each white
temple&mdash;were distinct to me as I looked at her,
even in the half light. Her face, with its wondrous
dark eyes, was full toward me, meeting this danger
for such as it might be; so that, again, I saw the
sweet full oval of her brow and cheek and chin,
with just these two dark incipient curls above. I
could not see the twin dark tendrils at the white
nape of her neck, but I knew they were there, as
beautiful as ever. Her mouth was always the
sweetest God ever gave any woman&mdash;and I repeat,
I have seen and studied all the great portraits, and
found none so wholly good as that of Helena, done
by Sargent in his happiest vein. Now the red
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
bow of her lips parted, as she stood, one slender
hand across her bosom, panting, but not in the least
afraid, or, at least, meeting her fear boldly, as
one high-born should.</p>

<p>She was all in white, with not the slightest jewel
or ornament of any kind. I saw that even the
buckle at her waist was covered in white. Her
boots and her hair were dark; for Helena knew
the real art of dressing. She stood fairly between
me and the deck light, so that all her white figure
was frank in its gentle curves; erect now, and
bravely drawn to all her five feet five, so that she
might meet my gaze&mdash;albeit through a mask&mdash;as
fully as a lady should when she has met affront.</p>

<p>I always loved Helena, always, from the first
time I met her. I had bidden adieu to life when,
after many efforts to have her see me as I saw
her, I turned away to the long hard endeavor to
forget her. But now I saw my attempts had all
been in vain. If absence had made my heart more
fond, the presence of her made it more poignantly,
more imperiously, fonder than before. My whole
body, my whole soul, unified, arose. I stretched
out my arms, craving, demanding. &ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; I
cried.</p>

<p>My voice was hoarse. Perhaps she did not know
me, even yet. Her answer was a long clear call
for help.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; she sang. &ldquo;On shore, there&mdash;Help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her call was a signal for present trouble. Partial,
my dog, abandoned in the long boat, began
barking furiously. There came an answering hail
which assured me that yon varlet, Davidson, had
heard. I was conscious of the sound of a scuffle
somewhere forward. Below, at my side, Aunt
Lucinda gave voice to a long shrill wail of terror.
John, my Chinaman, his cue still held fast in the
jammed edges of the door, chimed in dismally.
Midships I heard a muffled knocking at Williams&rsquo;,
the engineer&rsquo;s, hatch.</p>

<p>I forgot I was standing masked, with a naked
weapon in my hand. I dropped my mask, dropped
my weapon, and turned quickly toward Helena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; I commanded her.</p>

<p>She stood for one instant, her hands at her
cheeks. Then, &ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; rang out her voice once
more in sheer disobedience, and &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said
to me, furious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I,&rdquo; was my answer, and my own fury
was now as cold as hers. &ldquo;Go below,&rdquo; I ordered
her. &ldquo;I am in command of this boat. Quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had never spoken thus to her in all my life,
but almost to my surprise she changed now. As
though half in doubt, she turned toward the stair
leading down to the ladies&rsquo; cabin where Aunt Lucinda
was shrieking in terror.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
&ldquo;Guard the door,&rdquo; I called to L&rsquo;Olonnois as I
turned away. I heard it slam shut and the click
of the lock told me my prisoners were safe, so I
hastened forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Mr. Harry!&rdquo; cried my skipper,
Peterson, when he saw me. &ldquo;Come here, take this
little devil&mdash;away&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll knife me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurried to him for he struggled in the dark
with Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the rescue, Black Bart!&rdquo; called Jean Lafitte.
&ldquo;Catch his other arm. I&rsquo;ve got this one, and if
he moves, by Heaven I&rsquo;ll run him through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run me through, you varmint&mdash;what do you
mean?&rdquo; roared Peterson. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it enough you
pull a gun on me and try to poke out my eye, and
twist off my arm, without sticking me with that
bread-slicer you got? Mr. Harry&mdash;for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;enough. He
has begged for quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I ha&rsquo;int,&rdquo; asserted Peterson venomously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spank the life outen him if I ever get
the chance&mdash;&rdquo; I raised a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of all this noise,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am in
charge now, Peterson. Go to the wheel. Break
out the anchor and get under way. At once, man!
I have no time to argue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peterson had never in his life heard me speak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
in this way before, but now, for what reason I do
not know&mdash;perhaps from force of habit, perhaps
because he knew I was owner of the boat, perhaps
in awe of the naked kris of Jean Lafitte, still
presented menacingly at his abdomen&mdash;the old
skipper obeyed.</p>

<p>I heard the faint jangle of bells in the engine-room
below. Obviously, Williams, the engineer,
was responsive to his sense of duty and routine.
The power came pulsing through the veins of the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> and I heard her screws revolve. I,
myself, threw in the donkey winch as she forged
ahead, and so broke out the anchor. It still swung,
clogging her bows as she turned in the current.
The bells again jangled as she got more speed and
as the anchor came home. Our search-light swept
a wide arc along the foot of Natchez Hill, as our
bows circled about and headed down the great
river. And now we picked in full view, hardly
sixty fathoms distant, the dingey, pulled furiously
toward us. My friend, the varlet Cal Davidson,
half stood in the stern of the stubby craft and
waved at us an excited hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there, Peterson!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Stop! Hold
on there! Wait! Where are you going there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peterson turned toward me an inquiring gaze,
but I only pointed a hand down-stream, and he
obeyed me! I reached my hand to the cord and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
gave Peterson, Davidson, Natchez and all the
world, the salute of a long and vibrant whistle of
defiance. It came back to us in echoes from the
giant bluffs, swept across the lowlands on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead, Peterson,&rdquo; said I quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, Mr. Harry?&rdquo; he demanded
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It all depends&mdash;maybe
around the world. I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared about this&mdash;it don&rsquo;t look right.
What&rsquo;s come into you, Mr. Harry?&rdquo; asked the
old man solicitously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;except that the
bird of time is on the wing. I am a pirate, Peterson&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew you so far gone in drink before,
Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said he, as he threw over the wheel
to pick up the first starboard channel light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been drinking, Peterson,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;I have been drinking the wine of life. It oozes
drop by drop, and is all, too soon, gone if we delay.
Full speed ahead, Peterson. I am in command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean!&rdquo; I called to my able lieutenant. &ldquo;Reach
over into the long boat and bring Partial on board.
He is my friend. And bring also our flag. Run
it aloft above our prize.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir,&rdquo; came the reply of Jean Lafitte.
And a few moments later our long boat was riding
astern more easily. Jean Lafitte on his return
busied himself with our burgee. And at that
moment, Partial, overjoyed at also having a hand
in these affairs, barked joyously at his discovery
of the neglected end of the cook&rsquo;s cue projecting
through the hinges of the door. On this he laid
hold cheerfully, worrying it until poor John
shrieked anew in terror; and until I freed him;
and ordered tea.</p>

<p>I next went over to the hatches of the engine-room,
and having opened them, bent over to speak
to Williams, the engineer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Williams,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am going
to take her over now and run her perhaps to the
Gulf. We hadn&rsquo;t time to tell you at first. There
has been a legal difficulty. Peterson is on deck, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said Williams, who
recognized me as he leaned out from his levers to
look up through the open hatch. &ldquo;At first I didn&rsquo;t
know what in hell was up. It sounded like a
mutiny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a mutiny, Williams,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I am
the head mutineer. But you&rsquo;re sure of your pay,
so let her go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did let her go, smoothly and brilliantly, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
that before long she was at her top speed, around
fifteen knots an hour. I was familiar with every
detail of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, and now I looked in
both the generating plant and the storage batteries,
so that four thousand candle-power of electric
light blazed over her from bow to fantail. The
steady purr of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne&rsquo;s</i> double sixties&mdash;engines
I had had made under my own care&mdash;came
to me with a soothing rhythm where I stood near by
the wheel. Her search-light made a vast illumination
far ahead. Brilliant enough must have seemed
the passing spectacle of our stanch little ship to
any observer, as we now swept on down the tawny
flood of the great river. Who would deny me
the feeling of exultation which came to me? Was
I not captor and captain of my own ship?</p>

<p>I turned to meet L&rsquo;Olonnois, my blue-eyed pirate.
He stood at my side as one glorified. The full
swing of romance had him, the full illusion of this,&mdash;imagination&rsquo;s
most ardent desire&mdash;now gripped
him fully. He was no boy, but a human being possessed
of all his dreams. His second self, once
oppressed, now free, stood before me wholly satisfied.
I needed not to ask whether he had been
faithful to his trust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I locked the door on &rsquo;em, Black Bart,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and bade them cease a idle remonstrancing. &lsquo;Little
do you know,&rsquo; say I to them, &lsquo;that Black Bart the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
Avenger is now on the trail. Let any oppose him
at their peril,&rsquo; says I to them. She give me candy,
the fair captive did, but I spurned her bribe. &lsquo;Beware,&rsquo;
says I to her. &lsquo;Little do you know what lies
before you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS CONVERSATION WITH THE CAPTIVE
MAIDEN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>EAN LAFITTE, who had so well executed the
work assigned him in the boarding party&rsquo;s plans,
proved himself neither inefficient nor unobservant.
He approached me now, with a salute, which probably
he copied from Peterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, good leftenant?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Black Bart,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;how are
we headed, and what are our plans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our course on this river, Jean Lafitte, will box
the compass, indeed box an entire box of compasses,
for no river is more winding. Yet in time
we shall reach its end, no doubt, since others have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about our good ship, the <i>Sea Rover</i>,
that we have left behind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;that is,
indeed, a true word. What, indeed? We left her
riding at anchor just off the channel edge, and so
far as I recall, she had not her lights up, in accordance
with the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we put about and take her in tow, Black
Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means. That is the very last of my intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll become of her, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no concern of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But nobody&rsquo;ll know whose she is, and nobody
can tell what may happen to her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite true. She may be stolen, or sunk. Why
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she cost a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, she cost only twelve hundred
dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve hundred dollars!&rdquo; Jean drew a long
deep breath. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anybody had that
much money in the world. Besides, look what you
spent for them pearls. Ain&rsquo;t you poor, then, Black
Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I have that much more money
left, very likely. And I do not, to say truth,
care a jot, a rap or a stiver, what becomes of
the derelict <i>Sea Rover</i> now. Have we not taken
a better ship for our own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but suppose yon varlet boards the <i>Sea
Rover</i>, an&rsquo; chases us the way we done him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, by Jove! Jean Lafitte; an idea. But
suppose he does? Much good it will do him. For,
look you, good leftenant, the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> will not
stop to send any man ashore for baseball scores.
Such was not the practise of the old buccaneers,
nor shall it be ours; whereas, no matter what the
haste, yon varlet could in nowise refrain from
that same folly which hath lost him his ship to us.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
Each hour will only widen the gap between us.
Let him take our tub if he likes, and do as he likes,
for &rsquo;twill be a long day before he picks up our
masts over his horizon, Jean Lafitte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; rejoined my lieutenant, and
withdrew. I could see he was not overjoyed at the
abandonment of our earlier ship that had brought
us so far in safety. All this luxury of the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i> had the effect of oppressing a pirate who
so short a time ago had started out on the high
seas in a sixteen foot yawl, and who had seen that
yawl, in a manner of speaking, grown into a
schooner, the schooner comparatively grown into
a full-fledged four-decker, richly fitted as any ship
of the royal navy.</p>

<p>But these, all, were lesser things to me, for on
my soul was a more insistent concern. I turned
now, seeing that Peterson, wholly reconciled to
the new order of affairs, was speeding the boat
onward as though I never had left her; so that I
knew she was safe in his hands, although I set
Lafitte to watch him. Followed by my faithful
friend Partial, who expressed every evidence of
having enjoyed a most interesting evening, I presently
made my way aft.</p>

<p>As I approached the door of the after-cabin
suite, occupied by the ladies, I made my presence
known at first discreetly, then more pointedly, and,
at length, by a knocking on the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
&ldquo;Below, there!&rdquo; I called, boldly as I could;
for eager as I was to see Helena Emory, there
were certain things about the interview which might
be difficult. Lovers who have parted, finally, approach
each other, even by accident, thereafter,
with a certain reluctance. (Lovers, did I say?
Nay, never had she said she loved me. She had
only said she wished she did, wished she could.)</p>

<p>No answer came at first. Then, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
in the voice of Aunt Lucinda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, Mr. Henry&mdash;&rdquo; but I paused: &ldquo;&mdash;It is
I, Black Bart the Avenger,&rdquo; I concluded. &ldquo;May
I come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silently the door opened, and I entered the little
reception-room which lay between the two staterooms
of this cabin. Before me stood Helena!
And now I was close to her, I could see the little
curls at her temples, could see the double curves
of her lips, the color in her cheek. Ah! she was
the same, the same! I loved her&mdash;I loved her not
the same, but more and more, more!</p>

<p>She held her peace; and all I could do was to
stand and stare and then hold out my hand. She
took it formally, though her color heightened. I
saluted Aunt Lucinda also, who glared at me.
&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; I said to them both, with
much originality and daring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Bart!&rdquo; snorted Aunt Lucinda. &ldquo;Black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
Bart! It might be, from these goings on. What
does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means, my dear Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
I have taken charge of the boat myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; demanded Helena. &ldquo;We did not
hear you were coming. And I don&rsquo;t understand.
Why, that rascally little nephew of mine, in the
mask, frightened auntie nearly to death. And
he said the most extraordinary <em>things</em>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Davidson?&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t tell us a word of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know a word of it himself,&rdquo; I
answered. &ldquo;Let me tell you, no self-respecting
pirate&mdash;and as you see, I am a pirate&mdash;is in the
habit of telling his plans in advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pirate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed politely. &ldquo;At your service. Black Bart&mdash;my
visiting cards are mislaid, but I intend ordering
some new ones. The ship&rsquo;s cook, John,
will soon be here with tea. These events may have
been wearying. Meantime, allow me to present
my friend Partial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Partial certainly understood human speech. He
now approached Helena slowly and stood looking
up into her face in adoration. Then, without
any command, he lay down deliberately and rolled
over; sat up, barked; and so, having done all his
repertory for her whom he now&mdash;as had his master
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
before him&mdash;loved at first sight, he stood again and
worshiped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice doggie!&rdquo; said Helena courteously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Helena!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Love my dog,
love me! And all the world loves Partial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color heightened in her cheeks. I had never
spoken so boldly to her before, but had rather dealt
in argument than in assertion; which I, later, was
to learn is no way to make love to any woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do we get back to Natchez?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not get back to Natchez.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? Then I suppose Mr. Davidson picks us
up at Baton Rouge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yon varlet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;does not pick us up at
Baton Rouge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;New Orleans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or at New Orleans&mdash;unless he is luckier than
I ever knew even Cal to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Aunt Lucinda
in tones ominously deep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> is much faster than the
tug we left behind at Natchez, even did he find it.
He will have hard work to catch us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To <em>catch us</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Helena, to catch us. Of course he&rsquo;ll follow
in some way. I have, all the way from above
Dubuque. Why should not he?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
The ladies looked from me to each other, doubting
my sanity, perhaps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just understand all this,&rdquo; began Helena.
&ldquo;But since we travel only as we like, and only with
guests whom we invite or who are invited by the
boat&rsquo;s owner, I shall ask you to put us ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On a sand-bar, Helena? Among the alligators?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I mean at the nearest town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is none where we are going, my dear
Miss Emory. Little do you know what lies before
you! Black Bart heads for the open sea. Let yon
varlet follow at his peril. Believe me, &rsquo;twill cost
him a very considerable amount of gasoline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right have you on this boat?&rdquo; she demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The right of any pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you intrude&mdash;how dare you&mdash;at least,
I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken this ship, Helena,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;because
it carries treasure&mdash;more than you know of, more
than I dreamed. My father was a pirate, I am
well assured by the public prints. So am I. &rsquo;Tis
in the blood. But do not anger me. Rather, have
a cup of tea.&rdquo; John, my cook, was now at the
door with the tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; rejoined Helena icily. &ldquo;It would
hardly be courteous to Mr. Davidson&mdash;to use his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
servants and his table in this way in his absence.
Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, I recalled that your Aunt Lucinda&rsquo;s
neuralgia is always benefited by a glass or so
of ninety-three at about ten thirty of the evening.
John!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lessah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the left-hand locker in B; and bring me
a bottle of the ninety-three. I think you will find
that better than this absurd German champagne
which I see yon varlet has been offering you, my
dear Mrs. Daniver. But&mdash;excuse me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helena looked up, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;A moment before there were six empty
bottles on the table there. And I saw you writing.
How many have you thrown overboard through
the port-hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were so observant,&rdquo; replied
Helena demurely. &ldquo;But only three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not enough,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Go on, and write
your other messages for succor. Use each bottle,
and we shall have more emptied for you, if you
like. You shall have oil bottles, vinegar bottles,
water bottles, wine bottles, all you like. Yon
varlet might run across one, floating, it is true.
I hope he will. Methinks &rsquo;twould bid him speed.
But all in vain would be your appeal, for swift
must be the craft that can come up with Black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
Bart now. And desperate, indeed, must be the
man would dispute his right to tread these decks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are enjoying yourself,&rdquo; said Helena
scornfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you have tea, Helena?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, dear Mr. Davidson!&rdquo; sniffed Aunt Lucinda,
taking a glance out the port into the black
night. &ldquo;I wonder where he is, and what he will
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you what he will say, my dear Mrs.
Daniver,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I would rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what <em>I</em> say,&rdquo; snorted Aunt
Lucinda. &ldquo;I think this joke has gone far enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no joke, madam. I was never so desperately
in earnest in all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then put us ashore at Baton Rouge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not. I shall not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Do you know what this
looks like, the way you are acting, running off with
Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s yacht, and this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s robbery, and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, why it&rsquo;s abduction,
too. You ought to know the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do know the law. It is piracy. Have we
not told you that resistance would be worse than
useless? Haven&rsquo;t I told you I&rsquo;ve captured this
ship? Little do you know the fate that lies before
you, madam, at the hands of my ruthless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
men if I should prove unable to restrain them!
And have a care not to offend Black Bart the
Avenger, himself! If you do, Aunt Lucinda, he
may cut off your evening champagne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard a sudden suppressed sound, wondrous
like a giggle; but when I turned, Helena was sitting
there as sober as Portia, albeit I thought her
eyes suspiciously bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, at length, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t sit here
all night and talk about it, and I&rsquo;ve used up all my
note-paper and bottles. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I suggest,
since you have seen fit to intrude on two
women in this way. We will hold a parley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not at breakfast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we shall eat alone, here,&mdash;auntie and
I&mdash;in our cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then, if it seems you are so bitter
against the new commander of the ship that you
will not sit at the captain&rsquo;s table&mdash;as we did the
second time we went to Europe together, we three&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you remember, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;at your table, sir!&rdquo; said Helena Emory,
her voice like a stab. And when I bethought me
what that had meant before now, what it would
mean all my life, if this woman might never sit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
at board of mine, never eat the fruit of my bow
and spear, never share with me the bread of life,
for one instant I felt the cold thrust of fate&rsquo;s
steel once more in my bowels. But the next
instant a new manner of feeling took its place, an
emotion I never had felt toward her before&mdash;anger,
rage!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said I, pulling together the best I
could. &ldquo;And now, by my halidom! or by George!
or by anything! you shall be taken at your word.
You breakfast here. Be glad if it is more than
bread and water&mdash;until you learn a better way of
speech with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again I saw that same sudden change on her
face, surprise, almost fright; and I swear she
shrank from me as though in terror, her hand
plucking at Aunt Lucinda&rsquo;s sleeve; whereas, all
Aunt Lucinda could do was to pluck at her
niece&rsquo;s sleeve in turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the parley, then,&rdquo; said I, pulling, by mistake,
my mask from my pocket instead of my kerchief,
&ldquo;we shall hold it, to-morrow, at what time
and in what place I please. It ill beseems a gentleman
to pain one so fair, as we may again remark;
but by heaven! Helena, no resistance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! What do you really mean?&rdquo; She raised
a hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you I just can&rsquo;t understand
all this. I always thought you were a&mdash;a&mdash;gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
&ldquo;A much misused word,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;You
never understood me at all. I am not a gentleman.
I&rsquo;m a poor, miserable, unhappy, drifting, aimless
and useless failure&mdash;at least, I was, until I resolved
upon this way to recoup my fortunes, and went in
for pirating. What chance has a man who has
lost his fortune in the game to-day&mdash;what chance
with a woman? You ask me, who am I? I am
a pirate. You ask what I intend to do? What
pirate can answer that? It all depends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On you!&rdquo; I answered furiously. &ldquo;What right
had you to ruin me, to throw me over&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned a frightened glance to Aunt Lucinda,
whom I had entirely forgotten. It was my turn
to blush. To hide my confusion I drew on my
mask as I bowed.</p>

<p>I met John coming down with the ninety-three.
As he returned on deck a moment later, I pushed
shut the doors and sprung the outside latches; so
that those within now were prisoners, indeed.
And then I stood looking up at the stars, slowly
beginning to see why God made the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS FURTHER PARLEY WITH THE CAPTIVE
MAIDEN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>AL Davidson&rsquo;s taste in neckwear was a trifle
vivid as compared with my own, yet I rather
liked his shirts, and I found a morning waistcoat of
his which I could classify as possible; beside which
I obtained from John the cook a suit of flannels I
had given him four years ago, and which he was
saving against the day of his funeral and shipment
back to China. So that, on the whole, I did
rather well, and I was not ill content with life as
I sat, with the <i>Pirate&rsquo;s Own Book</i> in my lap, and
Partial&rsquo;s head on my knee, looking out over the
passing panorama of the river. The banks now
were low, the swamps, at times, showing their
fan-topped cypresses close to where we passed;
and all the live oaks carried their funereal Spanish
moss, gray and ghostlike.</p>

<p>We sometimes passed river craft, going up or
down, nondescript, dingy and slow, for the most
part. Sometimes we were hailed gaily by monkey-like
deck-hands, sometimes saluted by the pilot of
a larger boat. At times we swept by busy plantation
landings where the levees screened the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
white-pillared mansion houses so that we could only see
the upper galleries. And now at these landings,
we began to see the freight, made up as much of
barrels as of bales. We were passing from cotton
to cane. But though it still was early in the fall,
the weather was not oppressive, and the breeze
on the deck was cool. I had very much enjoyed
my breakfast, and so had my shipmates L&rsquo;Olonnois
and Lafitte, to whom each moment now was
a taste of paradise revealed. I envied them, for
theirs, now, was that rare, fleeting and most delectable
of all human states, the full realization of
every cherished earthly dream. It made me quite
happy that they were thus happy; and as to the
right or wrong of it, I put that all aside for later
explanation to them.</p>

<p>I looked up to see Peterson, who touched his
cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Peterson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our last drum of gasoline, Mr.
Harry,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll we put in&mdash;Baton
Rouge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t do that, Peterson,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we make it to New Orleans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly. But they carry gas at most of these
landings now&mdash;so many power boats and autos
nowadays, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. We&rsquo;ll pass Bayou Sara and Baton
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
Rouge, and then you can run in at any landing
you like, say twenty miles or so below. Can you
make it that far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but you see, at Baton Rouge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may lay to long enough to mail these letters,&rdquo;
said I, frowning; &ldquo;but the custom of getting
the baseball scores is now suspended. And send
John here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man touched his cap again, a trifle
puzzled. I wondered if he recognized Davidson&rsquo;s
waistcoat&mdash;he asked no more questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said I to my Chinaman, &ldquo;carry this to
the ladies;&rdquo; and handed him a card on which I
had inscribed: &ldquo;Black Bart&rsquo;s compliments; and
he desires the attendance of the ladies on deck
for a parley. At once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John came back in a few moments and stood
on one foot. &ldquo;She say, she say, Misal Hally, she
say no come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Letter have got, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lessah have got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it back. Say, at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lessah. At wullunce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lessah,&rdquo; he added two moments later. &ldquo;Catchee
lettah, them lady, and she say, she say, go to
hellee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! What&rsquo;s that, John? She said nothing
of the sort!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
&ldquo;Lessah, said them. No catchee word, that
what she mean. Lady, one time she say, she say,
go topside when have got plenty leady for come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to your work, John,&rdquo; said I. And
I waited with much dignity, for perhaps ten minutes
or so, before I heard any signs of life from
the after suite. Then I heard the door pushed
back, and saw a head come out, a head with dark
tendrils of hair at the white neck&rsquo;s nape, and two
curls at the temple, and as clean and thoroughbred
a sweep of jaw and chin as the bows of the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> herself. She did not look at me,
but studiously gazed across the river, pretended to
yawn, idly looked back to see if she were followed;
as she knew she was not to be.</p>

<p>At length, she turned as she stepped out on the
deck. She was fresh as the dew itself, and like
a rose. All color of rose was the soft skirt she
wore, and the little bolero above, blue, with gold
buttons, covered a soft rose-colored waist, light
and subtle as a spider&rsquo;s web, stretched from one
grass stalk to another of a dewy morning. She
was round and slender, and her neck was tall and
round, and in the close fashion of dress which
women of late have devised, to remind man once
more of the ancient Garden, she seemed to me
Eve herself, sweet, virginal, as yet in a garden
dew-sweet in the morning of the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
She turned, I say, and by mere chance and in
great surprise, discovered me, now cap in hand,
and bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she remarked; very much surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Eve,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Have you used
Somebody&rsquo;s Soap; or what is it that you have
used? It is excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint color came to her cheek, the corners of
her bowed lips twitched. &ldquo;For a pirate, or a person
of no culture, you do pretty well. As though
a girl could sleep after all this hullabaloo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have slept very well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You never
looked better in all your life, Helena. And that
is saying the whole litany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are absurd,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You must not
begin it all again. We settled it once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We settled it twenty times, or to be exact,
thirteen times, Helena. The only trouble is, it
would not stay settled. Tell me, is there any one
else yet, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not any question for you to ask, or for
me to answer.&rdquo; She was cold at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
tried to hear of you or your plans, and I suppose
the same is true of you. It is long since I have had
a heartache over you&mdash;a headache is all you can
give me now, or ever could. That is why I can not
in the least understand why you are here now.
Auntie is almost crazy, she is so frightened. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
thinks you are entirely crazy, and believes you
have murdered Mr. Davidson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not yet done so, although it is true I
am wearing his shoes; or at least his waistcoat.
How do you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the one with pink stripes better,&rdquo; she
replied demurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So then&mdash;so then!&rdquo; I began; but choked in
anger at her familiarity with Cal Davidson&rsquo;s waistcoats.
And my anger grew when I saw her smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, are you engaged to him, Helena?&rdquo;
I demanded. &ldquo;But I can see; you are.&rdquo; She
drew herself up as she stood, her hands behind
her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine question to ask, isn&rsquo;t it? Especially in
view of what we both know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And am not going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is the right of a middle-aged woman
like myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Twenty-four,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;To do as she likes in such matters. And
she doesn&rsquo;t need make any confidences with a
man she hasn&rsquo;t seen for years. And for whom
she never&mdash;she <em>never</em>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; said I, and I felt pale, whether or
not I looked it, &ldquo;be careful. That hurts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, is it so?&rdquo; she blazed. &ldquo;I am glad if it
does hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed to her. &ldquo;I am glad if it gives you
pleasure to see me hurt. I am. <i>Habeo!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was not so as to me,&rdquo; I added presently.
&ldquo;Yes, I said good-by to you, that last time,
and I meant it. I had tried for years, I believe,
with every argument in my power, to explain to
you that I loved you, to explain that in every
human likelihood we would make a good match
of it, that we&mdash;we&mdash;well, that we&rsquo;d hit it off fine
together, very likely. And then, I was well enough
off&mdash;at first, at least&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;It is like opening
a grave. We buried it all, Harry. It&rsquo;s over.
Can&rsquo;t you spare a girl, a middle-aged girl of
twenty-four, this resurrection? We ended it. Why,
Harry, we have to make out some sort of life for
ourselves, don&rsquo;t we? We can&rsquo;t just sit down and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I tried it. I got me a little
place, far up in the wilderness with what remained
of my shattered fortunes&mdash;a few acres. And I
sat down there and tried that &lsquo;and&mdash;and&rsquo; business.
It didn&rsquo;t seem to work. But we don&rsquo;t get on much
in our parley, do we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. The most charitable thing I can think
of is that you are crazy. Aunt Lucinda must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
right. But what do you intend to do with us? We
can&rsquo;t get off the boat, and we can&rsquo;t get any answer
to our signals for help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have signaled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Waved things, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful! The passing steamers no doubt
thought you a dissipated lot of northern joy-riders,
bound south on some rich man&rsquo;s yacht.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instead of two troubled women on a stolen
boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you engaged to Cal Davidson, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What earthly difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, none at all. As you say, I have stolen
his boat, stolen his wine, stolen his fried potatoes,
stolen his waistcoats. But, bear witness, I drew
the line at his neckties. Nowhere else, however!&rdquo;
And as I added this I looked at her narrowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you put us ashore?&rdquo; she asked, her color
rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to a town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baton Rouge. The capital of Louisiana. A
quaint and delightful city of some sixty thousand
inhabitants. The surrounding country is largely
devoted to the sugar industry. But we do not
stop. Tell me, are you engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, suddenly, I saw her face, and on it was
something of outraged dignity. I bent toward her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
eagerly. &ldquo;Forgive me! I never wanted to give
you pain, Helena. Forget my improper question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been fair with you. And that&rsquo;s hard for
a man. Always, always,&mdash;let me tell you something
women don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;there&rsquo;s the fight
in a man&rsquo;s soul to be both a gentleman and a
brute, because a woman won&rsquo;t love him till he&rsquo;s
a brute, and he hates himself when he isn&rsquo;t a
gentleman. It&rsquo;s hard, sometimes, to be both. But
I tried. I&rsquo;ve been a gentleman&mdash;was once, at
least. I told you the truth. When they investigated
my father, and found that, acting under the
standard of his day, he hadn&rsquo;t run plumb with the
standards of to-day, I came and told you of it.
I released you then, although you never had promised
me, because I knew you mightn&rsquo;t want an
alliance with&mdash;well, with a front page family, you
know. It blew over, yes; but I was fair with you.
You knew I had lost my money, and then
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remained &lsquo;released&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And am free, have been, to do as I liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what earthly right has a man to try both
r&ocirc;les with a woman&mdash;that of discarded and accepted?
You chose the first; and I never gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
you the last. It is horrible, this sort of talk. It
is abominable. For three years we have not met
or spoken. I&rsquo;ve not had a heartache since I told
you. Don&rsquo;t give me a headache now. And it
would make my head ache, to follow these crazy
notions. Put us ashore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till I know the truth,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for instance, about the waistcoat with
pink stripes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. How do you like my suit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw Mr. Davidson wear that one,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For good reasons. It is my own, and four
years old. You see, a poor man has to economize.
And you know, since I lost my fortune, I&rsquo;ve been
living almost from hand to mouth. Honestly,
Helena, many is the time when I&rsquo;ve gone out
fishing, trying to catch me a fish for my supper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So does a poor girl have to economize,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are most sparing of the truth this morning,
Helena, my dear,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she blazed now at the tender
phrase. &ldquo;Fine, isn&rsquo;t it, when I can&rsquo;t get away?
If I could, I&rsquo;d go where I&rsquo;d never see or hear of
you again. I thought I had.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
&ldquo;But you have not. You shall hear and see me
daily till I know from your own lips the truth
about you and&mdash;and every and any other man on
earth who&mdash;well, who wears waistcoats with pink
stripes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a long ride then,&rdquo; said she calmly,
and rose.</p>

<p>I rose also and bowed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS HUE AND CRY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E ran by the river-front of Baton Rouge,
and lay to on the opposite side while our
dingey ran in with mail. I sent Peterson and Lafitte
ashore for the purpose, and meantime paced
the deck in several frames of mind. I was arrested
in this at length by L&rsquo;Olonnois, who was standing
forward, glasses in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and a humpin&rsquo; it
up, too. Look, Jean Lafitte is standin&rsquo; up, wavin&rsquo;
at us. Something&rsquo;s up, sure. Mayhap, we are
pursued by the enemy. Methinks &rsquo;tis hue and cry,
good Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It jolly well does look like it, mate,&rdquo; said I,
taking his glasses. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see the stubby dingey forced half out
the water by Peterson&rsquo;s oars, though she made
little speed enough. And I saw men hurrying on
the wharf, as though about to put out a boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Peterson?&rdquo; I shouted as he
came in range at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; It was Lafitte who answered.
&ldquo;Clear the decks for action. Yon varlet has wired
on ahead to have us stopped! They&rsquo;re after us!&rdquo;
So came his call through cupped hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
I ran to the falls and lowered away the blocks
to hoist them aboard, even as I ordered speed and
began to break out the anchor. We hardly were
under way before a small power boat, bearing a
bluecoated man, puffed alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What boat is this?&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>,
of Mackinaw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer&mdash;without order from me,&mdash;my bloodthirsty
mate, L&rsquo;Olonnois, brought out the black
burgee of the Jolly Rover, bearing a skull and
cross-bones. &ldquo;Have a look at that!&rdquo; he piped.
&ldquo;Shall we clear the stern-chaser, Black Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, wait! I&rsquo;ve got papers for you,&rdquo;
called the officer, still hanging at our rail, for I
had not yet ordered full speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hollered to me he was going to arrest us,
Mr. Harry,&rdquo; explained Peterson, much out of
breath. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about? What papers does
he mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The morning papers, very likely, Peterson,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;The baseball scores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you halt, now?&rdquo; called the officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, through the megaphone.
&ldquo;You have no authority to halt us. What&rsquo;s your
paper, and who is it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wire from Calvin Davidson, Natchez, charging
John Doe with running off with his boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not his boat,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but my
own, and I am not John Doe. We are on our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
way to the coast, and not under any jurisdiction
of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood up and drew a paper from his pocket,
and began to read. In reply I pulled the whistle
cord and drowned his voice; while at the same
time I gave the engineer orders for full speed.
Shaking his fist, he fell astern.</p>

<p>None the less, I was a bit thoughtful. After
all, the Mississippi River, wide as it was, ran within
certain well defined banks from which was no
escaping. We were three hundred miles or more
from the high seas, and passing between points
of continuous telegraphic communication; so that
a hue and cry down the river might indeed mean
trouble for us. Moreover, even as I turned to
pick up the course&mdash;for I had myself taken the
wheel&mdash;I saw the figure of Aunt Lucinda on the
after deck. She was on the point of heaving overboard
a bottle&mdash;I heard it splash, saw it bob astern.
&ldquo;Now, the devil will be to pay,&rdquo; thought I. But,
on second thought, I slowed down, so that distinctly
I saw the officer, also slowing down, stoop
over and take the bottle aboard his launch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, the launch!&rdquo; I hailed. He put a hand
at his ear as I megaphoned him. &ldquo;Take this message
for Mr. Calvin Davidson,&rdquo; I hailed. He
nodded that he heard. &ldquo;&mdash;That to-night John Doe
will wear his waistcoat, the one with the pink
stripes. Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
Apparently he did not get me, for he sat down
suddenly and mopped his face. We left him so.
And for aught I could know, he took back ashore
material for a newspaper story, which bade fair
to be better for the newspapers than for us on
board the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>; for, up and down the
river, the wires might carry the news that a crazy
man had been guilty of piracy, highway robbery,
abduction, I know not how many other crimes;
and to arrest him on his mad career they might
enlist all the authorities, municipal, county, state
and even national. &ldquo;John Doe,&rdquo; said I to myself,
&ldquo;if I really were you, methinks I should make
haste.&rdquo; None the less I smiled; for, if I were
John Doe only, then Calvin Davidson had no idea
who had stolen his chartered yacht, and who was
about to disport in his most cherished waistcoat!
The situation pleased me very much. &ldquo;L&rsquo;Olonnois,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;come hither, my hearty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir,&rdquo; replied that worthy. &ldquo;What is
it, Black Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, except I was just going to say that
I enjoy it very much, this being a pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;An&rsquo; let any pursue us at
their peril!&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS DISCUSSION OF TWO AUNTIES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>&rsquo;OLONNOIS was still all for training the stern-chaser
Long Tom (the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne&rsquo;s</i> brass
yacht cannon) on the enemy, and came to me presently
breathing defiance. &ldquo;&rsquo;F I only had any chain
shot in the locker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;beshrew me, but I
would pay him well for this! He&rsquo;s got my Auntie
Helen&rsquo;s auntie scared silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how about your Auntie Helena herself?&rdquo;
I asked of him. Thus far, he had been guilty of
no nepotism whatever, and had treated his auntie
as any other captive maiden, perchance fallen into
his ruthless hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she ain&rsquo;t so scared as she is mad, near&rsquo;s
I can see,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;She sat there when I
first drove &rsquo;em down-stairs, lookin&rsquo; at me, an&rsquo; she
says, &lsquo;Jimmy,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s all this foolishness?&rsquo;
An&rsquo; she reaches out her hand, an&rsquo; she
offers me candy&mdash;she makes awful nice fudges,
too. She knew that wasn&rsquo;t fair! But I says to
her. &lsquo;Woman, cease all blandishments, for now
you are in our power!&rsquo; An&rsquo; I liked that, fer I
been in her power long enough. Then she set
down, an&rsquo; near&rsquo;s I can tell, she got to thinking
things over. I know her&mdash;she&rsquo;ll try to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
&ldquo;She has tried to do so, my good leftenant, is
trying now. She and her Auntie Lucinda have
thrown over I know not how many bottles carrying
messages. It were only by mere chance yon varlet
could escape coming over some of them. Add this
to the fact that yon varlet has got the king&rsquo;s navy
after us, and marry! methinks we have full work
cut out for us. Not that stout heart should falter,
good leftenant, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We follow Black Bart the Avenger,&rdquo; said
L&rsquo;Olonnois, folding his arms and frowning heavily.
&ldquo;But say,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what seems funny to
me is, you and my Auntie Helen must of known
each other before now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all&mdash;that is, but casually, and
long years since. It had long since escaped my
mind.&rdquo; I felt myself flushing sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her that&mdash;I knew she was mistaken. I
was sure she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! Jimmy, you&rsquo;ll tell her nothing of the
kind. I only meant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she remembers you, I&rsquo;m almost sure, an&rsquo;
so does Aunt Lucinda. Aunt Lucinda, why I&rsquo;ve
heard her back home tell Auntie Helena about as
good fish in the sea, an&rsquo; she mustn&rsquo;t bother over
a man that&rsquo;s poor. Was it you, Black Bart? And
are you poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I stand before you now, Jimmy L&rsquo;Olonnois,
I&rsquo;m the poorest beggar in the world,&rdquo; said I.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have risked my all on one hazard. If I win,
I shall be rich beyond compare. If I fail, I shall
be poor indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows that. She knows you&rsquo;re poor, all
right. I heard Aunt Lucinda tell her often. She
said you was rich once, an&rsquo; lost it all, speculatin&rsquo;
in a mine or something; an&rsquo; what was the use
marryin&rsquo; a man who hadn&rsquo;t anything? I don&rsquo;t
know, but I think that was why Aunt Lucinda
worked up this trip with Mr. Davidson. He&rsquo;s got
money to burn&mdash;look at this yacht, an&rsquo; everything&mdash;an&rsquo;
I know him and Auntie Lucinda, anyhow,
have got it doped out that him an&rsquo; Auntie Helen&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to get married&mdash;even if they ain&rsquo;t now, so
far&rsquo;s I know. Anyhow, our takin&rsquo; the ship has
broke up something. But say, now, Black
Bart&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my good leftenant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> got a idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep. Looka here, now&mdash;why don&rsquo;t <em>you</em> just
do like the pirate book says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry the captive maid your own self?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt my color rise yet more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, now, that happened right along in them
days&mdash;pirate chief, he takes a beautiful maiden
captive, an&rsquo; after makin&rsquo; all his prisoners walk
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
the plank but just her, he offers his hand an&rsquo; fortune.
An&rsquo; lots of times, somehow, the beautiful
maiden she married the ruthless pirate chief, an&rsquo;
they lived happy ever after. Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that, Jimmy,&rdquo; I said, most
mendaciously; &ldquo;but the idea has some merit. In
fact, we&rsquo;ve already started in by taking the beautiful
maiden captive, and, mayhap, yon varlet yet
shall walk the plank, or swear a solemn oath never
to wear such waistcoats as these again. But one
thing lacks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maiden&rsquo;s consent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it don&rsquo;t! They never ast &rsquo;em&mdash;they just
married &rsquo;em, that was all. An&rsquo; every time, they
lived happy ever after. An&rsquo; they founded families
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; I raised a hand. &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, I wouldn&rsquo;t pay any attention
to Aunt Lucinda about it. She&rsquo;s strong for yon
varlet, for he&rsquo;s got the dough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t your Auntie Helena also&mdash;but no,
on second thought, I will not ask you that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why no, sure not&mdash;it&rsquo;s better to demand it of
her own fair lips, an&rsquo; not take no for a answer.
They always live happy ever after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Of course, Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;And so would you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
&ldquo;I know it! I know it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why just don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good leftenant, Black Bart will take your counsel
into full advisement. Later, we shall see.
Meantime, we must have a care for our good ship&rsquo;s
safety, for none may tell what plans yon varlet
may be laying to circumvent us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, I sought out Peterson and asked him
for his maps and charts.</p>

<p>There was, as I found by consulting these, a
deep bayou, an old river bed, that ran inland some
thirty miles, apparently tapping a rich plantation
country which was not served by the regular river
boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about this old channel,
Peterson?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all except from hearsay and what
you see here,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether
or not it has a bar at either end, but likely enough
it has at both, though we might crowd through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how about the gasoline supply?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough to get us in, at least. And, I say,
here&rsquo;s a sort of plantation post-office marked.
There&rsquo;s just a bare chance we could get a drum
or so in there. I don&rsquo;t think we can, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she drawing now as she runs, Peterson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four feet two inches. She&rsquo;s a shade low by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
the stern. We&rsquo;ve quite a lot of supplies aboard,
this early in the cruise. But I don&rsquo;t suppose we&rsquo;ve
got enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;water leaves no trail.
If there&rsquo;s no one watching when we open up this
next bend, run for the bayou, and we&rsquo;ll see if we
can get under cover. Of course, it&rsquo;s all a mistake
about Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s wiring on to have us stopped&mdash;though
we can&rsquo;t blame him, since he hasn&rsquo;t any
idea who it is that has run away with the boat.
But now, it suits me better to double in here, and
let the chase try to find us on the main river; if
there is any chase. You see, I don&rsquo;t want to disturb
the ladies unduly, and they might not understand
it all if we were overhauled and asked
to explain our change in the ownership.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, sir, and very good. I catch the
idea. But, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, if I might be so bold, what are your
plans about the two ladies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none which will effect your navigation
of the boat, Peterson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man flushed a shade. &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr.
Harry. I know you&rsquo;ll do nothing out of the way.
But the old hen&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the revered aunt, Peterson.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, the revered aunt. Well, sir, the revered
aunt, dash her!&mdash;--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dash her starry toplights, Peterson; and
even if need be, shiver her timbers! Go on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s been tryin&rsquo; to pull off a weddin&rsquo; on
this boat ever since we left Mackinaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? You mean that Mr. Davidson and
the revered aunt were getting on well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, bless your heart, no! It was the young
lady, Miss Emory. And she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I raised my hand. &ldquo;Never mind, Peterson. We
can&rsquo;t discuss that at all. But now, I&rsquo;m minded
to give my friend Mr. Davidson a little game of
follow-my-leader. And just to show how we&rsquo;ll do
that, we&rsquo;ll begin with a preliminary go at hide-and-seek.
Take the chance, Peterson, and run
into the bayou. I&rsquo;ll put off the small boat for
soundings. If we can get gas, and can get in, and
can get out unnoticed, maybe we can run by New
Orleans in the night, and none the wiser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where then, Mr. Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson, the high seas have no bridges, and
if they had, I should not cross them yet. Perhaps
if I did, I then should burn them behind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a mortal fine young woman, Mr. Harry,
a mortal fine one. I&rsquo;ll be sworn he makes a hard
run for her. But so can we&mdash;eh, Mr. Harry?
He&rsquo;ll like enough pocket us in here, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
I made no answer to this. The old man left me
to take the wheel, and I noted his head wag from
side to side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I ESTABLISH A MODUS VIVENDI</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S good fortune would have it, we swung in,
opposite the screened mouth of Henry&rsquo;s
Bayou, at a time when the stream was free of
all craft that might have observed us, although
far across the forest we could see a black column
of smoke, marking a river steamer coming up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick with that long boat, Lafitte,&rdquo; I ordered;
and he drew our old craft alongside as we slowed
down. &ldquo;Get over yonder and sound for a bar.
Take the boat hook. If you get four feet, we&rsquo;ll
try it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My hardy young ruffian was nothing if not
prompt, nor was he less efficient than the average
deck-hand. It was he who did the sounding while
Willie, our factotum, pulled slowly in toward
the mouth of the old river bed. I watched them
through the glasses, noting that rarely could Lafitte
find any bottom at all with the long shaft of
the boat hook. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right, Peterson,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;Follow on in, slowly&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want that
steamer yonder to catch us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Why</em> don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; A voice I should know, to
which all my body would thrill, did I hear it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
any corner of the world, spoke at my elbow. I
started for a half instant before I made reply,
looking into her dark eyes, sensible again of the
perfume most delirium-producing for a man: the
scent of a woman&rsquo;s hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, Helena,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I wish our boat to
lie unnoticed for a time, till the hue and cry has
lulled a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; She bent on me her gaze, so difficult
to resist, and smiled at me with the corners
of her lips, so subtly irresistible. I felt a rush of
fire sweep through all my being, and something
she must have noted, for she gave back a bit and
stood more aloof along the rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said I savagely, &ldquo;this boat runs by
all the towns, till we reach the Gulf, and the
open sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, Helena, we sail the ocean blue, you
and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forever, Helena. Or, at least, until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until you say you will marry me, Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no answer now at all beyond a scornful
shrug of her shoulders. &ldquo;Suppose I can not?&rdquo;
she said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can not, all the same you must and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
shall!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You shall be prisoner until you
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no law for such as you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. None on the high sea. None in my heart.
Only one law I know any more, Helena&mdash;I who
have upheld the law, obeyed it, reverenced it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law of the centuries, of the forest, of the
sea. The law of love, Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you go about it handsomely! If you wished
me to despise you, to hate you, this would be
very fit, what you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may hate me, despise me, Helena. Let
it be so. But you shall not ignore me, as you have
these three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was your fault; your wish&mdash;as well as my
wish. We agreed to that. Why bring it up again?
When the news came that you had quit your profession,
and just at the time you had lost all your
father&rsquo;s fortune and your own, had turned your
back and run away, when you should have stayed
and fought&mdash;well, do you think a girl cares for
that sort of man? No. A man must do something
in this world. He mustn&rsquo;t quit. He&rsquo;s got
to <em>fight</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even if he has nothing to work for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not even then. There are plenty of girls
in the world&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;And a man mustn&rsquo;t throw away his life
for any one woman. That isn&rsquo;t right. He has his
work to do, his place to make and hold. That&rsquo;s
what a woman wants in a man. But you didn&rsquo;t.
Now, you come and say we must forget all the
years of off-and-on, all the time we&mdash;we&mdash;wasted,
don&rsquo;t you know? And because I am, for a little
while, in your hands, you talk to me in a way of
which you ought to be ashamed. You threaten me,
a woman. You even almost compromise me. This
will make talk. You speak to me as though, indeed,
you were a buccaneer, and I, indeed, in your
power absolutely. If I did not know you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not. Forget the man you knew. I
am not he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spread out her hands mockingly, and yet
more I felt my anger rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am another man. I am my father, and his
great grandfather, and all his ancestors, pirates all.
I know what I covet, and by the Lord! nothing
shall stop me, least of all the law. I shall take
my own where I find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now listen!&rdquo; I concluded. &ldquo;I am master
on this ship, no matter how I got it. Late poor,
as you say, I shall be richer soon, for I shall take,
law or no law, consent or no consent, what I want,
what I will have. And that is you!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
&ldquo;Each day, at eleven, Helena,&rdquo; I concluded,
&ldquo;I shall meet you on the after deck, and shall try
to be kind, try to be courteous&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Harry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to be calm, too. I want to give you time
to think. And I, too, must think. For a time,
I wondered what was right, in case you had
really pledged yourself to another man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I had?&rdquo; she asked, sphinx-like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to discover that. Not that it would
make any difference in my plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would take what was another&rsquo;s?&rdquo; She
still gazed at me, sphinx-like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! By the Lord, Helena, my father did, and
his, and so would I! So would I, if that were
you! Let him fend for himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned from the rail, her color a little
heightened, affected to yawn, stretched her arms.</p>

<p>We were now passing over the bar, slowly, feeling
our way, our skiff alongside, and the shelter
of the curving, tree-covered bayou banks now
beginning to hide us from view, though the bellowing
steamer below had not yet entered our bend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that boy?&rdquo; she inquired lazily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, madam, is no less than the celebrated
freebooter, Jean Lafitte, who so long made this
lower coast his rendezvous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! And you&rsquo;re filling his head with
wild ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
&ldquo;Say not so; &rsquo;twas he and your blessed blue-eyed
pirate nephew, the cutthroat L&rsquo;Olonnois, who
filled my head with wild ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They took me prisoner, on my own&mdash;I mean,
at the little place where I stop, up in the country.
And not till by stern deeds I had won their confidence,
did they accept me as comrade, and, at
last, as leader&mdash;as I may modestly claim to be.
And do not think that you can wheedle either of
them away from Black Bart. L&rsquo;Olonnois remembers
you spanked him once, and has sworn a bitter
vengeance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you happen to start sailing down this
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I learned Cal Davidson had started&mdash;with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all that way you had it in mind to overtake
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and have done so; and have taken his
ship away from him, and for all I know his bride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so. I suppose he never knew that
you and I used to&mdash;well, to know each other, before
I lost my money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never spoke of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No difference, unless all for the better, for I
shall, now, never give you up to any man on
earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
&ldquo;And I thought you the best product of our
civilization, a man of education, of breeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not breeding, unless savagery gives it.
I&rsquo;m civilized no longer. When you stand near
me, and your hair&mdash;go below, Helena! Go at
once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned, moved slowly toward her door.</p>

<p>I finished calmly as I could. &ldquo;To-morrow, at
eleven, I shall give you an audience here on the
deck. We shall have time. This is a wilderness.
You can not get away, and I hope no one will find
you. That is my risk. And oh! Helena,&rdquo; I
added, suddenly, feeling my heart soften at the
pallor of her face&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Helena, Helena, try to
think gently of me as you can, for all these miles
I have followed after you; and all these years I
have thought of you. You do not know&mdash;you do
not know! It has been one long agony. Now go,
please. I promise to keep myself as courteous as
I can. You and I and Aunt Lucinda will just
have a pleasant voyage together until&mdash;until that
time. Try to be kind to me, Helena, as I shall
try to be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silent, unsmiling, she disappeared beyond her
cabin door, nor would she eat dinner even in her
cabin, although Aunt Lucinda did; and found the
ninety-three was helping her neuralgia.</p>

<p>I know not if they slept, but I slept not at all.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
The shadows hung black about us as we lay at
anchor four miles inland, silent, and with no
lights burning to betray us. Now and again, I
could hear faint voices of the night, betimes croakings,
splashings in the black water about us. It
was as though the jungle had enclosed us, deep and
secret-keeping. And in my heart the fierce fever
of the jungle&rsquo;s teachings burned, so that I might
not sleep.</p>

<p>But in the morning Helena was fresh, all in
white, and with no more than a faint blue of
shadow beneath her eyes. She honored us at
breakfast, and made no manner of reference to
what had gone on the evening before. This, then,
I saw, was to be our <i>modus vivendi</i>; convention,
the social customs we all had known, the art, the
gloss, the veneer of life, as life runs on in society
as we have organized it! Ah, she fought cunningly!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Bart,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois, after breakfast
as we all stood on deck&mdash;Helena, Auntie Lucinda
and all&mdash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s all them things floatin&rsquo; around in
the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They look like bottles, leftenant,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;perhaps
they may have floated in here. How do you
suppose they came here, Mrs. Daniver?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; sniffed that lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good leftenant, go overside, you and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
Jean, and gather up all those bottles, and carry
them with my compliments to the ladies at their
cabin. You can have the satisfaction of throwing
them all overboard later on, Mrs. Daniver. Only,
remember, that there is no current in the bayou,
and they will stay where they fall for weeks, unless
for the wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where shall we be, then?&rdquo; demanded
Auntie Lucinda, who had eaten a hearty breakfast,
and I must say was looking uncommon fit for one
so afflicted with neuralgia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very likely here, in the same place, my dear
Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;unless war should break
out meantime. At present we all seem to have a
very good <i>modus vivendi</i>, and as I have no pressing
engagements, I can conceive of nothing more
charming than passing the winter here in your
society.&rdquo; Saying which I bowed, and turning to
Helena, &ldquo;At eleven, then, if you please?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I HAVE POLITE CONVERSATION, BUT
LITTLE ELSE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> HAD myself quite forgotten my appointed hour
of eleven, feeling so sure that it would not be
remembered, as of covenant, by the party of the
second part, so to speak, and was sitting on the
forward deck looking out over the interesting pictures
of the landscape that lay about us. It was
the morning of a Sabbath, and a Sabbath calm
lay all about us&mdash;silence, and hush, and arrested
action. The sun itself, warm at a time when soon
the breezes must have been chill at my northern
home, was veiled in a soft and tender mist, which
brought into yet lower tones the pale greens and
grays of the southern forest which came close
to the bayou&rsquo;s edge. The forest about us not yet
fallen before the devastating northern lumbermen&mdash;men
such as my father had been, who cared
nothing for a tree or a country save as it might
come to cash&mdash;was in part cypress, in part cottonwood,
but on the ridge were many oaks, and over
all hung the soft gray Spanish moss. The bayou
itself, once the river, but now released from all
the river&rsquo;s troubling duties, held its unceasing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
calm, fitted the complete retirement of the spot, and
scarce a ripple broke it anywhere. Over it, on
ahead, now and then passed a long-legged white
crane, bound for some distant and inaccessible
swamp; all things fitting perfectly into this quiet
Sabbath picture.</p>

<p>My cigar was excellent, I had my copy of
Epictetus at hand, and all seemed well with the
world save one thing. Here, at hand, was everything
man could ask, all comforts, many luxuries;
and I knew, though Helena did not, that the safe
increase of my fortune&mdash;that fortune which some
had called tainted, and which I myself valued
little, soon as I had helped increase it by the exercise
of my profession&mdash;was quite enough to
maintain equal comfort or luxury for us all our
lives. But she was obstinate, and so was I. She
would not say whether she loved Cal Davidson,
and I would never undeceive her as to my supposed
poverty. Why, the very fact that she had
dismissed me when she thought my fortune gone&mdash;that,
alone, should have proved her unworthy
of a man&rsquo;s second thought. Therefore, ergo, hence,
and consequently, I could not have been a man;
for I swear I was giving her a second thought,
and a thousandth; until I rebelled at a weakness
that could not put a mere woman out of mind.</p>

<p>And then, I slowly turned my head, and saw her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
standing on the after deck. Her footfall was not
audible on the rubber deck-mats, and she had not
spoken. I resolved, as soon as I had leisure, to
ask some scientific friends to explain how it was
possible that with no sound or other appeal to
any of the sensorial nerves, I could, at a distance
of seventy-five feet, become conscious of the presence
of a person no more than five feet five, who
had not spoken a word, and was standing idly
looking out over the ship&rsquo;s rail, in quite the opposite
direction from that in which I sat. And
then the ship&rsquo;s clock struck six bells, and recalled
the appointment at eleven. Hastily I dropped
Epictetus and my cigar, and hurried aft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning again, Helena,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>She stood looking on out over the water for
a time, but, at length, turned toward me, just a
finger up as to stifle a yawn. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;while I am hardly so situated that I can well
escape it or resent it, it does seem to me that you
might well be just a trifle less familiar. Why not
&lsquo;Miss Emory&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, Helena, I like &lsquo;Helena&rsquo; better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slow anger came into her eyes. She beat
a swift foot on the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stamp with your feet.
It reminds me of a Belgian hare, and I do not
like them, potted or caged.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
&ldquo;I might as well be one,&rdquo; she broke out, &ldquo;as
well be one, caged here as we are, and insulted by
a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ruthless buccaneer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a ruthless buccaneer, who has remembered
only brutalities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And forgotten all amenities? Why, Helena,
how could you! And after all the cork-tipped cigarettes
I have given you, and all the ninety-three I
have given your Auntie Lucinda&mdash;why look at the
empty message bottles she and you have thrown
out into the helpless and unhelping bayou&mdash;a perfect
fleet of them, bobbing around. Shan&rsquo;t I send
the boys overboard to gather them in for you
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine education you are giving those boys,
aren&rsquo;t you, filling their heads with lawless ideas!
A fine debt we&rsquo;ll all owe you for ruining the character
of my nephew Jimmy. He was such a nice
nephew, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your admiration is mutual, Miss Emory&mdash;I
mean, Helena. He says you are a very nice
auntie, and your divinity fudges are not surpassed
and seldom equaled. It is an accomplishment,
however, of no special use to a poor pirate&rsquo;s bride;
as I intend you shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had turned her back on me now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, as to that,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I am only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
affording these young gentlemen the same advantages
offered by the advertisements of the United
States navy recruiting service&mdash;good wages, good
fare, and an opportunity to see the world. Come
now, we&rsquo;ll all see the world together. Shall we
not, Miss Emory&mdash;I mean, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live here forever, anyhow,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could,&rdquo; was my swift answer. &ldquo;Forever,
in just this quiet scene. Forever, with all the
world forgot, and just you standing there as you
are, the most beautiful girl I ever saw; and once,
I thought, the kindest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I was much mistaken in you, much disappointed.
It grieved me to see you fall below
the standard I had set for you. I thought your
ideals high and fine. They were not, as I learned
to my sorrow. You were just like all the rest.
You cared only for my money, because it could
give you ease, luxury, station. When that was
gone, you cared nothing for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood looking at her lovely shoulders for some
time, but she made no sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And therefore, finding you so fallen,&rdquo; I resumed,
&ldquo;finding you only, after all, like the other
worthless, parasitic women of the day, Miss Emory&mdash;Helena,
I mean&mdash;I resolved to do what I could
to educate you. And so I offer you the same footing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
that I do your nephew&mdash;good wages, good
fare, and an opportunity to see the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer whatever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the Bay of Naples, at sunset,
as we saw it when we first steamed in on
the old <i>City of Berlin</i>, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you recall Fuji-yama, with the white
top&mdash;remember the rickshaw rides together,
Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, the fiords of Norway, and the
mountains? Or the chalk cliffs off Dover? And
those sweet green fields of England&mdash;as we rode
up to London town? And the taxis there, just
you and I, Helena, with Aunt Lucinda happily
evaded&mdash;just you and I? Yes, I am thinking of
forcing Aunt Lucinda to walk the plank ere long,
Helena. I want a world all my own, Helena, the
world that was meant for us, Helena, made for
us&mdash;a world with no living thing in it but yonder
mocking-bird that&rsquo;s singing; and you, and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not dispense with the mocking-bird&mdash;and
me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; (I winced at her thrust, however). &ldquo;No,
not with you. And you know in your heart, in
the bottom of your trifling and fickle and worthless
heart, Helena Emory, that if it came to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
test, and if life and all the world and all happiness
were to be either all yours or all mine, I&rsquo;d
go anywhere, do anything, and leave it all to you
rather than keep any for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I might, I should. But male and female
made He them. I spoke of us as units human,
but not as the unit <i>homo</i>. Much as I despise you,
Helena, I can not separate you from myself in
my own thought. We seem to me to be like old
Webster&rsquo;s idea of the Union&mdash;&lsquo;one and indivisible.&rsquo;
And since I can not divide us in any
thought, I, John Doe, alias Black Bart, alias the
man you once called Harry, have resolved that
we shall go undivided, sink or swim, survive or
perish. If the world were indeed my oyster, I
should open it for us both; but saying both, I
should see only you. Isn&rsquo;t it odd, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is eleven-thirty,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost time for luncheon. Do you think me
a &lsquo;good provider,&rsquo; Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Mr. Davidson was. While your
stolen stores last in your stolen boat, I suppose
we shall not be hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or thirsty?&rdquo; She shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or barren of cork-tips of the evening? Or
devoid of guitar strings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall need none.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah, but you will! It belikes me much, fair
maid, to disport me at ease this very eve, here on
the deck, under the moon, and to hear you yourself
and none other, fairest of all my captives, touch the
lute, or whatever you may call it, to that same
air you and I, fair maid, heard long ago together
at a lattice under the Spanish moon. A swain
touched then his lute, or whatever you may call it,
to his Dulcinea. Here &rsquo;tis in the reverse. The
fair maid, having no option, shall touch the lute, or
whatever you call it, to John Doe, Black Bart, or
whatever you may call him; who is her captor,
who feels himself about to love her beyond all
reason; and who, if he find no relief, presently,
in music&mdash;which is better than drink&mdash;will go
mad, go mad, and be what he should not be, a
cruel master; whereas all he asks of fate is that
he shall be only a kind captor and a gentle friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her head held very high, she passed me without
a word and threw open the door of her suite.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/tlatp05.jpg" width="318" height="500"
alt="Helena sits playing a guitar" />
<span class="caption">It was a love song of old Spain</span>
</div>

<p>... And that night, that very night, that very
wondrous, silent, throbbing night of the Sabbath
and the South, when all the air was as it seemed
to me in saturation, in a suspense of ecstasy, to
be broken, to be precipitated by a word, a motion,
a caress, a note ... that night, I say, as I sat
on the forward deck alone, I heard, far off and
faint as though indeed it were the lute of Andalusia,
the low, slow, deep throb of a guitar!...
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
My whole heart stopped. I was no more than a
focused demand of life. Reason was gone from
me, not intellect but emotion&mdash;that is its basic
thing after all, emotion born on earth but reaching
to the stars.... I listened, not hearing....
It was the air we had heard long ago, a love song
of old Spain, written, perhaps, before DeSoto and
his men perished in these very bayous and forests
that now shielded us against all tumult, all turmoil,
all things unhappy or unpleasant. The full
tide of life and love swept through my veins as
I listened.</p>

<p>I rose, I hastened. At her door I paused.
&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; I called raucously. &ldquo;Helena.&rdquo; And
she made no reply. &ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; I called again. &ldquo;It
was the same old air. This is Spain again! Ah,
I thank you for that same old air. Helena, forgive
me. May I come in&mdash;will you come out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I halted. A cold voice came from the companionway
door. &ldquo;You have a poor ear for music,
John Doe. It is not the same. Do you think I
would take orders from you, or any other man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood irresolute a moment, and then did
what I should not have done. I pulled open her
door. &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; I demanded. But then I
closed the door and went away. She was sitting,
her head bowed on the instrument she had played.
And when she looked up, startled at my rudeness,
I saw her eyes wet with tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE MAKE A RUN FOR IT</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;G</span>ADZOOKS! Black Bart,&rdquo; remarked L&rsquo;Olonnois
at the breakfast table the next morning,
&ldquo;and where is the captive maiden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;Better go
find out, Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He departed, but presently, returned somewhat
troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Auntie Helen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I mean the captive
maid, why, she says she&rsquo;s got a headache and
don&rsquo;t want no breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even a grapefruit and a cup of coffee?&rdquo;
I demanded, anxiously and, it must be admitted,
somewhat guiltily; for I knew that the soul of
Helena was grieved and whatever the trouble, the
fault was my own. Surely I had placed the poor
captive in a most difficult position, and loving her
as I did, how could I continue to give her discomfort?
My resolution almost weakened. I was
considerably disturbed.</p>

<p>And yet as I faced the alternative of setting
her free, and once more taking up the aimless and
unhappy life I had led these last three years without
sight of her, something&mdash;I suppose the great
selfishness which lies under love&mdash;rose up and said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
me nay; and I began to make excuses in favor of
my desire, as that, surely, soon she would come to
a more reasonable way of thought. And in one
thing, at least, I was honest with myself, deceitful
as are lovers with themselves, and arguing ever in
their own favor&mdash;I did not know why Helena had
wept, and it was perhaps my right to know.</p>

<p>One selfishness with another, I resolved to go
on with this matter, though knowing full well how
difficult would be my battle with her, how unequal;
for I was armed only with a great love, backed
by no art at all, whereas, she merely would continue
to unmask against me new batteries of defense&mdash;severe
politeness, formality with me; laughter
and scornfulness of me; anger, pitifulness, at
last even tears; and always the dread assault of
her eyes, and the scent of her hair and the sweet
wistfulness of her mouth,&mdash;all, all the charms of
all women united in her one self, to attack, to
assail, to harass, and to make wholly wretched the
man who loved her more than anything in life,
and who was driven almost to using any means, so
only that she might not be away, not be out of
sense and sight; as out of mind and out of heart
she never more might be. So that, all in all, it
were, indeed, hard question whether she or I were
the more wretched. Surely grapefruit and toast
and coffee seemed to me but inventions of the
powers of darkness at that breakfast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
Not so my hardy mates, however, who ate with
the keen appetite of youth, from fruit through
bacon and toast and back again, both talking all
the while. Nor, as the event proved, altogether
unwisely. Indeed, it was stout Jean Lafitte who
resolved my doubts, and by suggesting the simple
medicine of action rather than meditation, sufficed
for the removal of one of my two minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho! Black Bart,&rdquo; said he, after his third
helping of bacon, &ldquo;why does our good ship lie here
idle at her anchor?&rdquo; Question direct, like Jean
himself, and demanding direct answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Captain Peterson,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;He perhaps
can tell where we can get more gasoline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he can&rsquo;t. I asked him this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;twould seem we must lie here all winter,
unless discovered by some relief expedition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we start a relief expedition of our
own?&rdquo; demanded he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, me and Willy, the deck-hand, we&rsquo;ll take
the long boat an&rsquo; go out an&rsquo; explore this region
roundabout. Somebody may have gasoline somewhere,
and if so, we can git it, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your idea is excellent, Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Within the hour you shall set forth to see whether
or not there is any settlement on this bayou. And
that you may not need use violence when secrecy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
is our wish, here is a fat purse for our stores.
And hasten, for of a truth, Jean Lafitte, I am most
aweary of this very morning, and I long to see
the white seas roll once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was determined, therefore, that we should
fare onward&mdash;in case we could fare at all&mdash;with
our ship&rsquo;s company as it now was; for, of course,
none but myself knew what was afoot between
Black Bart and his captive. And well enough I
knew that in keeping Helena Emory thus close to
me, I was breeding sleepless nights and anxious
days.</p>

<p>This day itself was anxious enough, nor could
all of Epictetus teach me calm philosophy, distracted
as I was over this situation, complex as it
was. As to the fortune of the long boat, we knew
nothing until, at three of the afternoon, I saw a
white speck of a sail round the bend of our bayou,
and saw that was hoisted, spirit fashion, over our
boat, which now, with following wind, rapidly
drew in toward us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; called out Jean Lafitte, when he
came within hail; and I saw now that he, indeed,
had a boat&rsquo;s load of gasoline in tanks, cans and
all manner of receptacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Town and a store, down there five miles,&rdquo; he
explained as I caught his gunwale with boat hook.
&ldquo;You can git anything there. Now, the Giants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
an&rsquo; the Cubs, why, they tied in the &rsquo;leventh inning
yesterday. An&rsquo; say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let me hear nothing of the
cursed Giants or the yet more accursed Cubs, for
I have more serious work afoot! Tell me, is there
a bar cutting off the other end of the bayou; and
how long is the bayou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixteen miles,&rdquo; answered the useful Lafitte,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; she seems like good water all the way. They
say there&rsquo;s seven foot on the bar, and the wood
boats run in and out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! And did you tell them who you were,
and why you wanted gasoline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I only said our automobeel was broke
down, an&rsquo; we wanted the baseball scores. That
was all. They ast who was we. I said you was
John Doe&mdash;you see, I didn&rsquo;t want to tell your real
name, so I didn&rsquo;t say Black Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t mention our boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not! Whose business is it what
pirates does? They strike hardest when least expected.
To-night we can run in an&rsquo; rob the store,
easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean!&rdquo; I cried, horrified, &ldquo;what do you mean?
Let me hear no more such talk, or by my halidom!
back you go to your home by first train. I&rsquo;ll not
be responsible for the ruin of any boy&rsquo;s morals in
this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well what do you think about that, Jimmy!&rdquo;
said Jean, somewhat cast down and much mystified.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we pirates, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t pirates live on booty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Booty enough you have in your boat, Jean,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and let us get it aboard and in our tanks,
for to-night we sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For to rob the store?&rdquo; anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, once more for the Spanish Main, my
hearties! I seek a greater treasure; and plenty of
danger, believe me, lies between here and there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;ll we start?&rdquo; queried L&rsquo;Olonnois eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night, at six bells. Make all ready,&rdquo; was
my reply.</p>

<p>And that very night, with our search-light half
covered, and at slow speed and with the sounding
lead going, Peterson felt his way out from our
moorings and along the full length of Henry&rsquo;s
Bayou, silently as he might. We saw few signs
of life beyond now and then a distant light in some
negro cabin, and with all the lights doused we
swept by like a ghost in the night, along the front
of the plantation at whose store my men had got
their gasoline. At last we broke open the lower
end of the bayou, which, coming in from the main
stream in a long open reach, showed like a lane
of faint light in the forest; and to my great relief
presently, felt the current of the great stream
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
pick us up, and saw the channel lights ahead, so
that we knew we might for a time, at least, advance
in safety.</p>

<p>In all this work, my two faithful lieutenants
were awake and alert; but I saw nothing of
Helena that day, nor had message either from her
or her aunt in the full round of twenty-four hours
since last we met. Had she sought deliberately
to repay me for the grief I caused her, Helena
could have devised no better plan than her silence
and her absence from my sight, after what time
I had seen her weep.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought of more practical sort came
to my mind. &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; I called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir;&rdquo; and L&rsquo;Olonnois saluted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember all those bottles floating around
in the bayou&mdash;did you take them all up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir, an&rsquo; she throwed a lot more in,
out o&rsquo; the cabin window. I was shootin&rsquo; at &rsquo;em
with the twenty-two, an&rsquo; busted some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, some was left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we sailed away, leaving there, no doubt,
the full story of our voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I. For once, the vigilance of Black Bart
faltered, L&rsquo;Olonnois, and he must yet, mayhap,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
make better amends for his fault. Full speed
ahead, now, Peterson,&rdquo; I added later as I went
forward. &ldquo;Run for New Orleans and with all you
can get out of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said the old man; and
I could feel the throb of her whole superstructure,
from stack to keelson, when he called on the
double-sixties of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> for all their
power. Nor did any seek to stay us in our swift
rush down the river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I WALK AND TALK WITH HELENA</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was nine of as fine a winter morning as the
South ever saw when at last, having passed
without pause all intervening ports, we found ourselves
at the city of New Orleans. Rather, in
the vicinity of that city; for when we reached the
railway ferry above the town, I ran alongshore
and we made fast the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> at a somewhat
precarious landing place. I now called Peterson
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine morning, Peterson,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but I think &rsquo;tis going to rain.&rdquo; (Peterson
was always gloomy.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go down-town, Peterson,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;The through train from the West is late and just
now is coming into the ferry. You can take it
easily. We have got to have still more gasoline,
for there is a long trip ahead of us, and I am not
sure what may be the chance for supplies below
the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going into the Gulf, Mr. Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Peterson. You will continue to navigate
the boat; and, meantime, you may be quartermaster
also. I shall be obliged to remain here until you
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
The old man touched his cap. &ldquo;Very good, sir,
but I&rsquo;m almost sure not to return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Peterson,&rdquo; I went on, well used to his
customary depression of soul, &ldquo;go to the ship&rsquo;s
furnisher, Lavallier and Thibodeau, toward the
Old Market. Tell them to have all our supplies
at slip K, below the railway warehouses, not later
than nine this evening. We want four drums
of gasoline. Also, get two thousand rounds of
ammunition for the twelve gages, ducking loads,
for we may want to do some shooting. We also
want two or three cases of grapefruit and oranges,
and any good fresh vegetables in market. All
these things must be ready on the levee at nine,
without fail. Here is my letter of credit, and a
bank draft, signed against it&mdash;I think you will find
they know me still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man touched his cap again but hesitated.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure to be asked something,&rdquo; he said somewhat
nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say nothing about any change of ownership
of this boat, Peterson, and don&rsquo;t even give the
boat&rsquo;s name, unless you must. Just say we will
meet their shipping clerk at slip K, this evening,
at nine. Hurry back, Peterson. And bring a
newspaper, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is any one else going down-town?&rdquo; asked Peterson.
&ldquo;I may run into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we shall all remain aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
He departed mournfully enough, seeing that the
ferry boat now was coming across with the railway
train. I continued my own moody pacing
up and down the deck. Truth was, I had not
seen Helena for more than twenty-four hours, nor
had any word come from the ladies&rsquo; cabin to give
me hope I ever would see her again of her own
will. My surprise, therefore, was great enough
when I heard the after cabin door close gently as
she came out upon the deck.</p>

<p>When last I saw her she had been in tears. Now
she was all smiles and radiant as the dawn! Her
gown, moreover, was one I had never seen before,
and she, herself, seemed monstrous pleased with it,
for, by some miracle, fresh as though from the
hands of her maid at home, she knew herself fair
and fit enough to make more trouble for mankind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said she, casually, as though
we had parted but lately and that conventionally.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful picture,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and you fit
into it. I am glad to see you looking so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could say as much for you,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;You look like a forlorn hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am nothing better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as though you had not slept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not, Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; her eyes wide open in surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
&ldquo;Because I knew I had either hurt or offended
you; and I would do neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done both so often that it should not
cost you your sleep,&rdquo; said she slowly. &ldquo;But if
you really want to be kind, why can you not have
mercy on a girl who has been packed in a hat box
for a month? Let me go ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not breathe quite as well where you
are, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can; and I will walk beside you
here on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I would like to pick flowers, over there
by the embankment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The train is too close,&rdquo; said I, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>Her color heightened just a little, but she did
not answer my suspicions. &ldquo;Please let me walk
with you over there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I used not to
need ask twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our situation is now reversed, Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, let me walk with you, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare not. We might both forget ourselves
and go off to New Orleans for a lark without
Aunt Lucinda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am going to call Aunt Lucinda, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, but you are going to do nothing of
the kind. Even with her as chaperon, did we get
down there in the old city once more, like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
children we once were, Helena, we would forget
our duty, would, perhaps, forget our purpose here.
Mademoiselle, I dare not take that risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Sir, may I walk with you over yonder
for just a little time?&rdquo; she said, as though it were
her first request. She was tying her quaint little
white bonnet strings under her chin now. I raised
a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask a man to put himself into the power
of the woman he loves most in all the world.
When a man needs resolution, dare he look into
the eyes of that woman, feel her hand on his arm,
have her walk close to him as they promenade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! Is it so bad as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse, Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am to continue a prisoner in that hat
box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until you love me, Helena, as I do you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I told you, that would be a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! For never in the world can you love
me as I do you. I had forgotten that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only you could forget everything and just
be a nice young man,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is such fun.
This dear old town, don&rsquo;t you know? Now, with
a nice young man to go about with Aunt Lucinda
and me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would a man like Calvin Davidson do?&rdquo;
I demanded bitterly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
&ldquo;Very well. He is nice enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. He is rich, able to have his
horses and cars&mdash;even his private yacht. He can
order a dinner in any country in the world, or tell
you the standing of any club, in either league, at
any minute of the day or night. Could I say more
for his education? He has two country places
and a city house and a business which nets him a
hundred thousand a year. How can he help being
nice? I do not resemble Mr. Davidson in any
particular, except that I am wearing one of his
waistcoats. Also, Helena, I am wearing a suit
of flannels which I have borrowed from John, his
Chinese cook. You can readily see I am a poor
man. How, then, can I be nice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one would see us here,&rdquo; said she, sublimely
irrelevant, as usual. &ldquo;There are some little
yellow flowers over there on the bank. Maybe I
could find some violets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a wistfulness in her gaze which made
appeal. I could not resist. &ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; said I suddenly,
&ldquo;give me your parole that you will not try
to escape, and I will walk with you among yonder
flowers. You look as though just from a Watteau
fan, my dear. It is fall, but seems spring, and
the world seems made for flowers and shepherds
and love, my dear. Do you give me your word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do, may I walk alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not try to take the train. On my honor,
I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked deep into her eyes and saw, as always,
only truth there&mdash;her deep brown eyes, filled with
some deep liquid light whose color I never could
say&mdash;looked till my own senses swam. I could
scarcely speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take your parole, Helena,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
never lied to me or any other human being in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I used often
to lie to mama, and frequently do yet to Aunt
Lucinda. But not if I say I give my word&mdash;my
real word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will you give me your real word, Helena?
You know what I mean&mdash;when will you say that
you love me and no one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said she promptly. &ldquo;I hate you very
much. You have been presumptuous and overbearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why then should you promenade with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fault of anything better, Sir!&rdquo; But she took
my hand lightly, smiling as I assisted her down
the landing way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; she added as we made our way
slowly up the muddy slope, &ldquo;really, Harry, how
long is this thing to last? When are we going
back home?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
&ldquo;How can you ask? And how can I reply,
save in one way, after taking the advice of yonder
pirate captain, your blue-eyed nephew? He
says they always live happy ever after. Listen,
Helena. Gaze upon this waistcoat! Forget its
stripes, and imagine it to be sprigged silk of a
day long gone by. Let us play that romance is
not yet dead. These are not cuffs, but ruffles at
my wrists&mdash;for all Cal Davidson&rsquo;s extraordinary
taste in shirts. All the world lies before us, and
it is yesterday once more. The Mediterranean,
Helena, how blue it is&mdash;the Bermudas, how fine
they are of a winter day! And yonder lies motley
Egypt and her sands. Or Paris, Helena; or Vienna,
the voluptuous, with her gay ways of life.
Or Nagasaki, Helena&mdash;little brown folks running
about, and all the world white in blossoms. All the
world, Helena, with only you and I in it, and
with not a care until, at least, we have eaten the
last of our tinned goods of the ship&rsquo;s supplies;
since I am poor. But if I could give you all that,
would I be nice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that suit you, Harry?&rdquo; she asked soberly;
&ldquo;just gallivanting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know it would not. You know I want
no vacation lasting all my life, nor does any real
man. You know it was yourself that forced me
out of my man&rsquo;s place and robbed me of my
greatest right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s place is to fight and
to work. It&rsquo;s the same to-day. But,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;you ran away; and you lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But am I not trying to recoup my fortune,
Helena? You see, I have already acquired a yacht,
although but a few weeks ago I started in the
world with scarcely more than my bare hands.
Could Monte Cristo have done more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t money a woman wants in a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Oh, come, we
mustn&rsquo;t go to arguing these things all over
again! I&rsquo;m weary of it. And certainly Aunt
Lucinda and I both are weary of our hat box
yonder. That&rsquo;s what I asked you, how long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as I like, Helena, you and your Aunt
Lucinda shall dwell there. What would you say
to three years or so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve found
a four leaf clover,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much good fortune may it bring you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try my fortune,&rdquo; said she, and began
plucking off the leaves. &ldquo;He loves me, he loves
me not; he loves me, he loves me not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, holding up the naked stem
triumphantly; &ldquo;I knew it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a fairer test, had you a daisy,
Helena,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or something with more leaves;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
not that I know whose has been this ordeal. Suppose
it were myself, and that you tried this one.&rdquo;
I handed her a trefoil, but she waved it aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try to find you a four leaf clover for
your own, after a while,&rdquo; said she, and bobbed
me a very pretty courtesy. Angered, I caught at
the stick I was carrying with so sudden a grip
that I broke it in two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know your hands were so strong,
Harry,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would they were stronger!&rdquo; was my retort.
&ldquo;And were I in charge of the affairs of Providence,
the first thing I would do would be to wring
the neck of every woman in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then set out to put them together again,
Harry? Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, naturally. But you must admit,
Helena, that women have no sense of reason whatever.
For instance, if you really were trying out
the fortune of some man on a daisy&rsquo;s head, you
would not accept the decree of fate, any more
than you could tell why you loved him or loved
him not. Why does a woman love a man, Helena?
You say I must not be silly&mdash;should I then be
wise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are much too wise, so that you often
bore me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor should he be poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. Rich men also usually are bores&mdash;they
talk about themselves too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should he be a tall man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too tall, for they&rsquo;re lanky, nor short, because
they get fat. You see, each girl has her own
ideal about such matters. Then, she always marries
a man as different as possible from her ideal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does she marry a man at all, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never knows. Why should she? But
look&mdash;&rdquo; she pointed out across the water&mdash;&ldquo;the
train is leaving the ferry boat. Isn&rsquo;t that Captain
Peterson going aboard the train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Helena, I&rsquo;ve sent him down-town to get
some light reading for you and your Aunt Lucinda&mdash;<i>Fox&rsquo;s
Book of Martyrs</i>, and the <i>Critique of
Pure Reason</i>&mdash;the latter especially recommended
to yourself. I would I had in print a copy of my
<i>magnum opus</i>, my treatment on native American
<i>culicid&aelig;</i>. My book on the mosquito is going to
be handsomely illustrated, Helena, believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned upon me with a curious look.
&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve changed in some ways.
If I were not so bored by life in yonder hat box,
I might even be interested in you for a few minutes.
You used always to be so sober, but now,
sometimes, I wonder if I understand you. Honestly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
you were an awful stick, and no girl likes a
stick about her. What do girls care which dynasty
it was that built the pyramids?&mdash;it&rsquo;s Biskra they
want to see. And we don&rsquo;t care when or why
Baron Haussmann built the Boulevard Haussmann
in Paris&mdash;it&rsquo;s the boulevard itself interests us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the fate of genius to be cast aside,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;No doubt even I shall be forgotten&mdash;even
after my book on the <i>culicid&aelig;</i> shall have been
completed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;So that,&rdquo; she went on, not noticing me,
&ldquo;there is that one point in your favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is a chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, for me to study you as you once did
me&mdash;as one of the <i>culicid&aelig;</i>, I presume. But if
you would listen to reason, and end this foolishness,
and set us all ashore, why, I would be almost
willing to forgive you, and we might be
friends again,&mdash;only friends, Harry, as we once
were. Why not, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wheedle well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but you forget
that what you ask is impossible. I am Black Bart
the Avenger, and the hand of every man is against
me. I am too deep in this adventure to end it
here. Why? I did not even dare go down-town
for fear I might be arrested. Nothing remains
but further flight, and when you ask me to fly and
leave you here, you ask what is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
She stood for a time silent, a trifle paler, her
flowers fallen from her hand, clearly unhappy,
but clearly not yet beaten. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said she
coldly, &ldquo;we must not be brutal to Aunt Lucinda
also. Let us go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;now you have back your parole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I should like an artichoke for luncheon,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Vinaigrette, you know.&rdquo; And she
passed aft, her head hidden by her white parasol,
but I knew with chin as high as though she were
Marie Antoinette herself. Nor did I feel much
happier than had I been her executioner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS A PRETTY KETTLE OF FISH</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ISS Helena Emory had her artichoke for luncheon,
and judging from my own, my boy
John never had prepared a better, good as he was
with artichokes; but we ate apart, the ladies not
coming to our table. It was late afternoon before
I saw Helena again, once more come on deck. She
was sitting in a steamer chair with her face leaning
against her hand, and looking out across the
water at the passing shipping. She sat motionless
a long time, the whole droop of her figure, the
poise of her tender curved chin, wistful and unhappy,
although she said no word. For myself,
I did not accost her. I, too, looked up and down
the great river, not knowing at what moment some
discerning eye might spy us out, and I longed for
nothing so much as that night or Peterson would
come.</p>

<p>He did come at last, late in the afternoon, on
an outbound train, and he hurried aboard as rapidly
as he might. The first thing he did was to hand
me a copy of an afternoon paper. I opened it
eagerly enough, already well assured of what news
it might carry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
On the front page, under a large, black head,
was a despatch from Baton Rouge relaying other
despatches received at that point, from many points
between Plaquimine and Bayou Sara. These, in
short, told the story of the most high-handed attempt
at river piracy known in recent years. The
private yacht of Calvin Davidson, a wealthy
northern business man, on his way South for the
winter, had been seized by a band of masked
ruffians, who boarded her while the yacht&rsquo;s owner
was temporarily absent on important business in
the city of Natchez. These ruffians, abandoning
their own boat, had at once gone on down-stream.
They had been hailed by officers of Baton Rouge,
acting under advice by wire from Mr. Davidson,
on his way down from Natchez. The robber band
had paid no attention to the officers of the law,
but had continued their course. In some way
the stolen craft had mysteriously disappeared that
afternoon and night, nor had any word of her
yet been received from points as far south as Plaquimine.
A bottle thrown overboard by one of
the prisoners taken on the yacht contained a message
to Mr. Davidson, with the request that he
should meet the sender at New Orleans; but there
was no signature to the note.</p>

<p>Many mysterious circumstances surrounded this
sensational piece of piracy, according to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
journalistic view-point. On board the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>
were two ladies, the beautiful young heiress, Miss
Helena Emory, well known in northern social
circles, and her aunt, Mrs. Lucinda Daniver, widow
of the late Commodore Daniver, United States
Navy. Mr. Davidson himself was unable to assign
any reason for this bold act of this abduction, although
he feared the worst for the comfort or
even the safety of the two ladies, whose fate at
this writing remained unknown. The greatest mystery
surrounded the identity of the leader of this
bold deed, whose name Mr. Davidson could not imagine.
He was reported to suspect that these same
river pirates, earlier in the day, attacked and perhaps
made away with a friend of his whose name
is not yet given. A cigarette case was found in the
abandoned boat, which Mr. Davidson thought
looked somewhat familiar to him, although he
could not say as to its ownership. He could and
did aver positively, however, that a photograph in
a leather case on the abandoned boat was a portrait
of none other than Miss Helena Emory, one
of the captives made away with by the river ruffians.
Mr. Davidson could assign no explanation
of these circumstances.</p>

<p>Later despatches received at Baton Rouge, so
the New Orleans journal said, might or might not
clear up the mystery of the stolen yacht&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
disappearance, although the senders seemed much
excited. One story from a down-river point,
brought in by an excited negro, told of a dozen
bottles found floating in the bayou. The negro,
however, had broken them all open, and declared
they had contained nothing but bits of paper, which
he had thrown away. He also told a wild story
that the plantation store at Hamlin&rsquo;s Landing, on
Bayou Henry, had been looted in broad daylight,
by a young man and a boy, apparently members
of the pirate crew. The younger of the two ruffians
was masked, and on being asked for pay for
gasoline, refused it at the point of his weapons,
declaring that pirates never paid.</p>

<p>While no attention should be paid to rumors
such as the latter, the despatches went on to say,
it was obvious that a most high-handed outrage
had been perpetrated. It was supposed that the
swift yacht had been hurried forward, and had
passed New Orleans in the night. Once out of
the river, and among the shallow bays of the Gulf
Coast, the ruffians might, perhaps, for some time
evade pursuit, just as did the craft of Jean Lafitte,
himself, a century ago. Meantime, only the greatest
anxiety could pervade the hearts of the friends
of these ladies thus placed in the power of ruthless
bandits. Such an outrage upon civilization
could, of course, occur only under the administration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
of the Republican party. The journal therefore
hoped:&mdash;and so forth, and so forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, after digesting this interesting
information, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve read this. What have
you to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peterson was more despondent even than was
his wont. &ldquo;It looks mighty bad, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t profess to understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you order the supplies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but they may forget to send them
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your intention to stick by me, Peterson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there must be some mistake,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what else I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a mistake, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;This
is more newspaper sensation. Mr. Davidson is
excited over something he doesn&rsquo;t understand.
If I had him here now I could explain it all easily.
But, before the matter can be explained in this
way, we must wait until this excitement dies down.
Why, at this gait, it would hardly be safe for
either of us to be recognized here in town. We
might be arrested and put to a lot of trouble. The
best thing we can do is to run on down the river
and wait until Davidson gets down and until we
get this thing adjusted. That is why I wanted
the supplies to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose we are discovered to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
&ldquo;We take that chance, but I fancy that I have
certain legal rights, after all, and I own this boat.
Fortune favors the bold. I shall make no attempt
to hide, either now or then, Peterson. At the
same time, while we will not run away from plain
sight, there is no need to take unnecessary chances.
Drop some white sail-cloth over the yacht&rsquo;s name
on her bows, and on the fantail. Have one or two
of the boys go overboard in slings and seem to be
painting her sides. That will give the look that
we are safe to lie here some time&mdash;which is the
last thing the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> really would do, or
will do. They think we&rsquo;ve run past the city already,
and they&rsquo;ll be watching at Quarantine, and
along the Lake Borgne Canal. Most of the yachts
go out that way, headed for Florida. We&rsquo;ll go the
other way. It&rsquo;s an adventure, Peterson, and one
which any viking, like yourself, ought to relish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I hardly
knew which course to lay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood will tell, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Your
ancestors were Danish pirates; mine were English
pirates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Harry, don&rsquo;t talk that
way. We mustn&rsquo;t go against the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that we have as yet, Peterson,
for the law says nothing about abduction of
ladies in pairs, or for purposes truly honorable.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
Frankly, Peterson&mdash;and because you&rsquo;ve been long
in my employ&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you something. I intend
to marry that young lady if she&rsquo;s not already married
to Mr. Davidson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, Mr. Harry, she ain&rsquo;t&mdash;at least not since
she come aboard the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said I, drawing a long breath,
&ldquo;this is not such a bad world after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Harry. I was going to say,
as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, but of
course I don&rsquo;t know about what she&rsquo;ll say. She
looks to me like one of these girls that&rsquo;s been petted
a good deal, and Mr. Harry, believe me, I
always fight shy of a pet horse, or a pet boat, or
a pet woman&mdash;they&rsquo;re always hard to handle, and
they raise the devil when they get a chance. I
hope you&rsquo;ll pardon me, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Peterson, I am grateful to
you. You are on double pay from the time I took
command. Moreover, I promise you the best
cruise we ever had together. Once among the
shallow bays on the coast down there, we can
take care of ourselves while this chase cools down.
We&rsquo;re faster than anything on the Gulf, and draw
less water than most of them of anything like
our speed. You take care of the boat and I&rsquo;ll
take care of the girl&mdash;or try to. I have attachment
papers all made out, to file on the boat if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
need be&mdash;and I also have an attachment for the
girl, when it comes to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the
easiest job,&rdquo; said he.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE HAVE A SENSATION</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH no more than these slight precautions
which I have indicated, we lay all that afternoon
in plain view of the world; and because all the
world could not suspect us of such hardihood, all
the world went by without suspecting that the
stolen <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> and her ruthless pirate crew
were there in full sight and apparently inviting or
defying apprehension. Sometimes a passing craft
would salute us as we lay, and we returned the
courtesy without fail. I know not whether more
bottles were cast overboard by Aunt Lucinda, but
if so, we heard of none. At last, after what
seemed days to me, though no more than hours,
the shade of twilight fell across the river, the outlines
of the passing boats grew less distinct. Now
and again we could hear the wail of railway
whistle, or see the curved snake of the lighted
train dashing across the alluvial lands toward the
ferry. Here and there, beyond, pin points of red
lights shone. At last the night fell full, and,
gladly enough, I gave the order for the continuance
of our journey.</p>

<p>We slipped down-stream gently and silently, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
speedily withal, seeking to time our arrival, as
nearly as we might, to the hour assigned for the
delivery of our supplies at the dock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m none too easy in my mind,&rdquo; said my old
skipper to me, as we stood together forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, Peterson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them two boys,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You talk of
pirates&mdash;there&rsquo;s the bloodiest pair of pirates as
ever was. I hardly know whether my own life&rsquo;s
safe or not, to hear them talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never do you mind, Peterson,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Those
boys may be useful to us yet. The one with blue
eyes has proved himself able to keep the ladies
in their cabin, and as for the one who was going
to run you through when we took the boat, he still
may have to work to keep Williams down in the
engine-room when we make our landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may come out all right,&rdquo; said the old man
gloomily, &ldquo;but sometimes I fear for the worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always do, Peterson, and that is no frame
of mind for a healthy pirate. But here we are
below the railway warehouse district, and I think
nearly opposite slip K, where we land. Port your
helm, and run in slow. We&rsquo;ve got to have gasoline,
although I must say my two bullies took
aboard quite a store up there at the Bayou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Port it is, sir,&rdquo; said Peterson gloomily, still
smoking. And he made as neat a landing as ever
in his life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
A shadowy form arose amidst the blackness of
the dock and came directly forward to take our
line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;Are you from
Lavallier and Thibodeau?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;Those supply
is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Help him get the stuff aboard,
Peterson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went about their work. Just as turning
I saw standing at my elbow, the slight form of
L&rsquo;Olonnois, his arms folded and hat drawn upon
his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bid the varlets hasten,&rdquo; he hissed to me.
&ldquo;Time passes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back to your post, L&rsquo;Olonnois,&rdquo; I rejoined.
&ldquo;See that the captives remain in their room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Lafitte, too, proved unable to restrain his
curiosity, and this time his habit of close observation
was of benefit in an unexpected way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hist, Black Bart!&rdquo; he whispered distinctly,
clutching my arm. &ldquo;What boat is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed in the dim light to a low lying, battered
power boat moored in the same slip with
us. Something in her look seemed familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see her name,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte, &ldquo;but
she looks a lot like our own old boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hastily stepped on the wharf and got a closer
look in the wavering beams of an arc light at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
name on the boat&rsquo;s bows. There, in indistinct and
shaky, but unmistakable characters, was the title
painted by my young ruffians, weeks earlier&mdash;<i>Sea
Rover!</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;you are right, and
now indeed we must have a care. Yon varlet has
beaten us into New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s board her and take her,&rdquo; hissed Jean
Lafitte. &ldquo;We can do it easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, wait,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Perhaps we can think of
a better plan. Wait till we get two drums of
gasoline aboard. Then we&rsquo;ll make a run for it,
if yon varlet is here on the <i>Sea Rover</i>. Probably
not, for every one seems gone to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte boldly, and
before I could stop him was gone, springing lightly
on the deck of the <i>Sea Rover</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello in there,&rdquo; he hailed. &ldquo;Are you all
asleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A voice muttered something from the shallow
cabin, I could not tell what. &ldquo;We got a barrel
of rum for you from Thibodeau&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you ain&rsquo;t. Must be some mistake,&rdquo; said
a sleepy voice; and now a tousled head appeared,
indistinct in the gloom. &ldquo;Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t know
anything about it, and it&rsquo;ll have to stay on the
dock until morning. I&rsquo;m only the engineer, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
come from Natchez. Mr. Davidson, he&rsquo;s up-town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte, apparently
mollified, and soon was at my side again. So
then, we had the information we sought. I was
sure my own engineer, Williams, was busy as
usual below, oiling and polishing his double sixties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry now,&rdquo; I whispered to Peterson. &ldquo;Get
that stuff aboard quick. Don&rsquo;t forget the crates
of fruit and vegetables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were nearly done with this work, when for
a moment all seemed on the point of going wrong
with us. I heard shufflings and door slammings
from the after cabin. &ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; sounded
the voice of Aunt Lucinda, somewhat muffled. It
chanced that my engineer, Williams, at that
moment poked his head up his ladder to get a
breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded of me as I passed.
&ldquo;I thought I heard some one calling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did, Williams,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It was Mrs.
Daniver. She suffers much with neuralgia and
is in great pain. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I should
have to go up-town and get a physician for her
even yet. But, Williams, in any case we&rsquo;ll be sailing
soon, and I want you to overhaul the screen
of the intake pipe for that port boiler. We&rsquo;re
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
getting into very sandy waters, and of course you
don&rsquo;t want anything to happen to your engines.
Can you attend to that at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, sir,&rdquo; said he, and went below again. I
closed the hatch on him. Meantime I hurried aft,
to see what could be done toward quelling any
possible uproar. My blue-eyed lieutenant, L&rsquo;Olonnois,
had been as efficient in his way as Jean Lafitte.
Now, in full character, he was enjoying
himself immensely. When I saw him, he was
standing with his feet spread wide apart in the
center of the cabin floor, with drawn sword in
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to Aunt
Lucinda, &ldquo;it irks me as a gentleman to be rude
with one so fair, but let me hear one more word
from you, and your life&rsquo;s blood shall dye the deck,
and you shall walk the plank at the morning sun.
You deal with L&rsquo;Olonnois, who knows no fear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deep silence, broken presently by a little laugh;
and I heard Helena&rsquo;s voice in remonstrance.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly, Jimmie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly, indeed,&rdquo; boomed the deep voice of Aunt
Lucinda, catching sight of me at the door. &ldquo;Yonder
is the villain who put him up to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that you?&rdquo; said Helena, coming toward
me. &ldquo;Where are we, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the port of New Orleans, Miss Helena,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
was my answer, &ldquo;a city of some three hundred
thousand souls, noted for its manufacture of
sugar, and its large shipments abroad of the staple
cotton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come on deck?&rdquo; she queried after a
while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are alongside the levee, and there is little
to see. We shall be sailing now in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mayn&rsquo;t I come up and see New Orleans,
even for a minute as we pass by? I&rsquo;ll be good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may come up under parole,&rdquo; said I, throwing
open the door. &ldquo;But you must bring your
aunt&rsquo;s parole also. You must give no alarm, for
we have every reason here for silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned back and held some converse with
Auntie Lucinda, and by what spell I know not,
won the promise of the latter to remain silent and
make no attempt at escape. A little later she was
at my side in the dim light cast by a flickering
and distant arc light at the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your word, then?&rdquo; I demanded of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You can&rsquo;t blame me for wanting to get
out, to see what is going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal may be going on here any moment,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;In fact, if I could show you the
evening newspapers&mdash;which I purpose doing to-morrow
morning&mdash;it might seem to you that a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
great deal already has gone on. For one thing,
Cal Davidson is in town ahead of us. That&rsquo;s his
boat yonder, rubbing sides with us. He doesn&rsquo;t
know we&rsquo;re here. He himself is off up-town, at
the Boston Club, probably, or perhaps some of
the caf&eacute;s&mdash;he knows a thousand people here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I, Harry,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;To think of going
by in this plight! And to think of leaving New
Orleans without even one little supper at Luigi&rsquo;s,
Harry&mdash;it breaks my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are almost ready to sail, Helena. Suppose
we see Luigi&rsquo;s some other time. Things are getting
pretty close about us here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any pirate should be a man of courage,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;he should be ever willing to take a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; have I not taken several chances
already?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And again, a pirate ought to be kind toward
all women, oughtn&rsquo;t he, Harry? I asked you this
afternoon, why couldn&rsquo;t we be friends again and
stop all this foolishness. Let&rsquo;s forget everything
and just be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Again, Helena? Have I not tried that
and found it a failure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no courage. You are no pirate. I
challenge you to a test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go up-town and have a little supper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
at Luigi&rsquo;s, the way we used to, Harry, when we
really were friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, with Cal Davidson loose in the town
and his boat lying here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the adventure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would turn me over to the authorities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I would sell my parole for a mess of
woodcock, Harry.&rdquo; She laid a hand upon my
arm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I want a little
supper at Luigi&rsquo;s, Harry. I like the Chianti there.
Between us we could afford thirty cents a bottle,
could we not? Now, if I gave my parole&mdash;and
of course, every one would be here at the boat just
the same&mdash;But of course, I did not expect you
would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is an adventure, because it will take
something of real courage, I fancy, to meet a
risk like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would be some risk for us all,&rdquo; said I
truly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go, balancing and not deciding.
You are no pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you give me if I go, Helena?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing beyond thanking you. One thing,
you must not think that I would trick or trap
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
&ldquo;Many a criminal has been trapped by a woman
whom he loves,&rdquo; said I slowly. &ldquo;But you would
not do that if I had your word, even though you
hated me. And you do hate me very much, do
you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very much. But if you took me by New
Orleans without a supper at Luigi&rsquo;s, I should hate
you even more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean&mdash;Jean Lafitte,&rdquo; I called out in a low tone
of voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; he saluted, as he came to the
place where we stood, like some seasoned sailorman,
regardless of youthful hours of sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going up-town with the captive maiden.
Do you stand here on watch. We shall be gone
about three hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hully gee!&rdquo; ejaculated Jean Lafitte, but at once
he saluted again. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well, Black Bart,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Captain Peterson to let no one come on
board this boat under any pretense; nor must any
one leave it until I get back. If any one asks for
me, say I&rsquo;m up-town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Aunt Lucinda going, too?&rdquo; demanded
Helena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She certainly is not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it quite correct for me to go alone
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
&ldquo;That is your part of the adventure, Helena,&rdquo;
said I calmly. An instant later I had led her
across the dingy warehouse dock, over dusty
streets, to a crooked street-car line over which I
could hear approaching one of the infrequent
cars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE MEET THE OTHER MAN, ALSO
ANOTHER WOMAN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>UIGI&rsquo;S place, as all men know, is situated
upon a small, crooked and very dirty street,
yet none the less, it is an abode of contentment
for those who know good living. When
Helena and I entered the door I felt as one
again at home. Here were the sanded floors,
the old water-bottles, the large chandelier with
its cut glasses in the middle of the room, the
small tables with their coarse clean linen. The
same old French waiters stood here and there
about, each with impeccable apron and very
peccable shoes, as is the wont of all waiters.
But the waiters at Luigi&rsquo;s are more than waiters;
they are friends, and they never forget a
face. Therefore, as always, I had no occasion
for surprise when Jean, my waiter these many
years at Luigi&rsquo;s, stepped forward as though it
had been but last week and not three years ago
when he had seen me. He called me by name,
greeted me again to his city, and gently aided
Helena with her wraps and gloves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And M&rsquo;sieu can not long remain away from
us, forever?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
&ldquo;It has been three years, Jean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;more
is the pity. But now, I can remain three hours&mdash;will
that serve? At the end of that time
we must away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean was human, yet discreet. He knew that
when last he saw me I was a single man. Now
he had doubts. He stood hovering about, a
question on his tongue, smitten of admiration
much as had been my dog, Partial, at his first
sight of Helena. At last he made excuse to
step close behind my chair under pretense of
finding my napkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Enfin, M&rsquo;sieu?</i>&rdquo; said he, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Pas encore</i>, Jean!&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>I saw a slow flush on Helena&rsquo;s cheek, but
she gave no other sign that she had overheard.
So I began forthwith making much ado about
ordering our supper, which as usual really was
much a matter of Jean&rsquo;s taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to-night in the ice-boxes, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo;
said that artist, &ldquo;some cock oysters which are
dreams. Moreover, I have laid aside two canvasbacks,
the best I ever saw&mdash;it was in the
hope that some really good friend of mine
would come in. Behold, I am happy&mdash;I must
have been expecting you. Believe me, we
have never had better birds than these. They are
excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the oysters, Jean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
small and dark. I presume possibly a very
small <i>fillet</i> of trout this evening, and the sauce&mdash;you
still can make it, Jean? Such <i>entr&eacute;es</i>
as you like, of course. But, since Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;
and here I smiled&mdash;&ldquo;and I, also, are
very hungry this evening, we wish a woodcock
after the canvasback, if you do not mind. Perhaps
it is not too much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais non!</i>&rdquo; replied Jean. &ldquo;You are of those
who know well that to eat too much is not to
dine well. But I shall bring you two oysters,
<i>marini&egrave;re</i>&mdash;a sauce my own wife invented. And
yes, some small bird, <i>beccasine</i>, broiled lightly&mdash;perhaps
you will enjoy it after the canvasback,
although I assure you those are excellent indeed.
We have few sweets here, as M&rsquo;sieu
knows, but cheese, if you like, and of course
coffee; and always we have the red wine which
I remember M&rsquo;sieu liked so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is with you, Jean,&rdquo; said I. And Helena,
turning, smiled upon him swiftly, in such fashion
that he scarce touched the floor at all as he
walked out for his radishes and olives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo; said Helena. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it like
the old times? I always loved this old town.
It seems so homelike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do not use that word, Helena,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;I wish to be entirely happy to-night, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
belief that some time I shall know what home
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think Jean knew me also?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;Certainly, I have been here also
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one who has ever seen you, Helena, ever
forgets you. But Jean is, of course, discreet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose he knew that I was here to-night
against my free will, and only under parole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean is wise; he knows such things ought
not to be, even if they are. And he understood
me when I said, &lsquo;not yet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;quite right. <i>Pas encore!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean returned, and as a special favor to an
old patron asked us politely if we would enjoy
a look through the kitchen and the ice-boxes.
As usual, we accepted this invitation, and
passed back through the green swing doors,
following our guide along the row of charcoal
fires, through a dingy room decorated with
shining coppers and bits of glass and silver.
These ice-boxes were such as to offer continual
delight to any epicure, what with their rows
of fat clean fishes and crabs and oysters, the
birds nicely plucked, all the dainties which this
rich market of the South could afford, from
papabotte to terrapin. Helena herself selected
two woodcock and approved the judgment of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
Jean in canvasback. Presently she turned to
me, a flush of embarrassment upon her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to say anything,
but you know&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been telling me
you were so poor. Now, a girl doesn&rsquo;t want
to make it difficult&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said I, bowing, &ldquo;I am quite
able to foot the bill to-night. I had just sold
some hay before I started from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m awfully hungry,&rdquo; she admitted;
&ldquo;besides, it&rsquo;s such a lark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; and presently, as we reached
our table again, I showed her the afternoon
papers, which as yet she had not seen. She
read through the account of our escapade, her
lips compressed; but presently she folded the
paper and laid it down without comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any minute, you see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I may be
apprehended and our little supper brought to
an end. That is why I hastened with the order.
I do not wish to hurry you in any way, however,
and we shall use the full three hours.
Although, of course, you see that the bird of
time indeed is on the wing to-night, as well as
those other birds on the broilers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She only looked at me steadily and made no
comment. &ldquo;Once suspected here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;all
is over for me, and you are free again. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
would be entirely easy for you to make some
sign or movement which I, perhaps, could not
detect. Perhaps, at any moment, some one may
enter who knows you&mdash;as I&rsquo;ve said, no one can
look at you and forget you, Helena. But
please let none of this affect your appetite.
Our little supper is our little adventure. I
hope you will enjoy both, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did take some chance, did you not?&rdquo;
she said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will be so nervous you can&rsquo;t enjoy
your spread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, Helena. A nervous man
has no business in the trade of piracy;&mdash;but,
ah! the <i>fillet</i> of trout, Helena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean was proud of his art, the chef proud
also, and the chef knew we were here. A general
air of comfort seemed to settle down upon
our little corner of the restaurant, a quiet contentment.
For the most part, folk came here
who had no hurry and no anxiety, and it was
a sort of club for many persons who knew how
to eat and to live and to enjoy life quietly, as
life should be enjoyed. None dreamed, of
course, that aught but equal leisure existed for
our little table, where sat a rather lank and
shabby man in flannels, and a very especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
beautiful young woman in half evening dress.
At Luigi&rsquo;s, every one is polite to every one else,
and the curiosity is but that of fraternity. Perhaps,
some eyes were cast our way, I could
not tell.</p>

<p>Jean, in slow solemnity and pleasant ease,
brought on many things not nominated in the
bond. At length he arranged his duck-press
on his little table near us, and having squeezed
the elixir from the two dissected fowls, began
to stir the juices into a sauce of his own, made
with sherry wine and a touch of <i>fil&eacute;</i>, many
things which Jean knows best. He was just
in the act of pouring this most delectable sauce
over the two bits of tender fowl upon our hot
plates, when, happening to look up, I saw
some one entering the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean, if you please,&rdquo; said I, deliberately pulling
the coat-rack in front of our table, &ldquo;Mademoiselle
perhaps feels a slight draft. Would
you fetch a screen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned. &ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; said I, after a moment,
&ldquo;now our adventure has come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why do
you do that?&rdquo;&mdash;she nodded at the screen. &ldquo;Why,
I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your parole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad it is yes!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
break it now and escape so easily. One little
move on your part and my punishment is at
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; she asked, suspecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one much,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only our esteemed
friend, Mr. Calvin Davidson, whose waistcoat
I am now wearing. Some one is with him, I
don&rsquo;t know who it is. A very nice-looking
lady, next to the most beautiful woman in this
room, I must say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said she; and I allowed her
to look through the crack in the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She certainly is very stunning,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
she not? Tall, dark, a trifle superb&mdash;I wonder&mdash;I
wonder sometimes, Helena, if Cal Davidson
is true to Poll?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; was her retort. &ldquo;But as you
say, here is our adventure, or at least yours.
How do you propose to get out of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Just at present
I do not wish this canvasback to get cold. We
have remaining before us two hours or more,
ample time to make any plan which may be
needed. Coffee, I have found, is excellent for
plans. Let us make no plans until we have
had our coffee, after our little dinner. That will
be an hour or so yet. Plenty of time to plan,
Helena,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And please do not slight this
bird&mdash;it is delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
Her eyes still were sparkling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather
glad I came,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I, and I shall be glad when we are
back. But meantime I trust you, Helena, absolutely.
I will even tell you more. Davidson&rsquo;s
boat, the one which we left him instead
of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, is lying in the same slip
with ours, rubbing noses with our yacht yonder,
as I showed you. Our men have talked with
his. They do not yet suspect that we are the
vessel which everybody wants to find. I am
very thankful their engineer was so sleepy. I
learned there at the wharf that Cal Davidson
was down-town at his club. He seems to have
departed long enough to find excellent company,
as usual. I am glad that he has done so,
for in all likelihood he will not return to his
own boat before to-morrow morning. He will
prefer his room at the club to his bunk on the
<i>Sea Rover</i>, if I know Cal Davidson. And by
that time I hope to be far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he know who you are&mdash;does he know
who it was that took the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. But, very stupidly&mdash;being so
anxious to see the original&mdash;I left a photograph
of yourself on our old boat, the <i>Sea Rover</i>.
Item, one cigarette case with my initials. Of
course, Cal Davidson may guess the simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
truth, or he may make a mystery of these
things. It seems he prefers to make a mystery;
and I am sure that suits me much better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But knowing these things&mdash;knowing that
his boat was lying right at the dock alongside
of us&mdash;why did you stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was you, Helena, who suggested
this little adventure at Luigi&rsquo;s! And I
promise you I am enjoying it very much. It
seems so much like old times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that can&rsquo;t ever be over again, Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally not. But often new times are
quite as good as old ones. I can conceive of
such a thing in our case. No, I shall use this
privilege of your society to the limit, Helena,
fearing I may not see you soon again, after
once I have put you back in your hat box. You
coaxed me to leave the boat, and I shall tell
you when to return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, at twelve o&rsquo;clock. Not earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you propose sitting here with me till
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could imagine no better pastime, were I
condemned to die at sunrise. Tell me, do you
wish me to call Mr. Davidson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do not, since I gave you my
word. Besides, I know that girl with him. It&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
Sally Byington. Some call her good-looking,
but I am sure I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie upon you! She is superb. In short,
Helena, I am not sure but she is finer-looking
than yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Cal Davidson, whatever may be his
taste in neckties or waistcoats, seems to me
excellent in this other regard. Perhaps just a
trifle flamboyant for Luigi&rsquo;s, but certainly stunning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our relations are not such as to lead me to
discuss our friends,&rdquo; she rejoined haughtily.
&ldquo;And, as you say, our duck is getting cold. I
adore these canvasbacks. I would like to come
back to-morrow and have another.&rdquo; She cut
savagely into her fowl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, Helena, to-morrow you will be far
away. In time I hope to reconcile you to the
simple life of piracy. Indeed, unless all plans
go wrong, we may very likely have canvasbacks
on the boat; although I can not promise you
that John will be as good a chef as our friend
here at Luigi&rsquo;s. All good buccaneers use their
fair captives well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! And why do you not ask Sally
Byington into your list of prisoners, since you
fancy her so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
&ldquo;Nay, say not so, Helena. I trust I am
somewhat catholic in taste regarding ladies, as
any gentleman should be, yet after all, I am
gentler in my preferences. Quite aside from
that, I find one fair captive quite enough to
make me abundant trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At about this time Jean approached behind
the screen, bearing a copy of a late edition of
an evening paper, which fortunately he seemed
not closely to have scanned. I took it quickly
and placed it with the front page down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur no doubt has heard of the great
sensation?&rdquo; commented Jean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, what is that, Jean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The papers have been full of nothing else.
It seems a band of cutthroat river pirates have
stolen a gentleman&rsquo;s yacht, and so far as can
be told, have escaped with it down the river,
perhaps entirely to the Gulf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, Jean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is a most extraordinary
thing. Are you sure of the facts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally&mdash;is it not all in the paper? This
gentleman then has his yacht anchored at
Natchez, and he goes ashore on important business.
Comes then this band of river ruffians
in the dark, and as though pirates of a hundred
years ago, and led by Jean Lafitte himself, they
capture the vessel!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu!</em> Jean you do not say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But assuredly I say so; nor is that all, Monsieur.
On board this yacht was a young and
beautiful lady of great wealth and beauty, as
well&mdash;the fianc&eacute;e, so it is said, of this gentleman
who owns the yacht. What is the action
of these pirates in regard to this beautiful
young lady and her aunt, who also is upon the
yacht for the cruise? Do they place these
ladies ashore? No, they imprison them upon
the boat, and so, <em>pouf!</em> off for the gulf. Nor
has any trace of them been found from that
time till now. A rumor goes that the gentleman
who owns the yacht is at this time in New
Orleans, but as for that unfortunate young
lady, where is she to-night? I demand that,
Monsieur. Ah! And she is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, is not this a most extraordinary tale
you bring, Jean? Let us hope it is not true.
Why, if it were true, that ruffian might escape
and hide for days or weeks in the bayous
around Barataria, even as Jean Lafitte did a
hundred years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly he might. Ah, I know it well,
that country. But Jean Lafitte was no pirate,
simply a merchant who did not pay duties.
And he sold silks and laces cheap to the people
hereabout&mdash;I could show you the very causeway
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
they built across the marsh, to reach the
place where he landed his boats at the heads of
one of the great bays&mdash;it is not far from the
plantation of Monsieur Edouard Manning, below
New Iberia. Believe me, Monsieur, the country
folk hunt yet for the buried treasure of Jean Lafitte;
and sometimes they find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You please me, Jean. Tell me more of
that extraordinary person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary, you may call him, Monsieur.
And he had a way with women, so it is said&mdash;even
his captives came to admire him in time,
so generous and bold was he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A daredevil fellow I doubt not, Jean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may say that. But of great good and
many kindnesses to all the folk in the lower
parts of this state in times gone by. Now&mdash;say
it not aloud, Monsieur&mdash;scarce a family in
all Acadia but has map and key to some buried
treasure of Jean Lafitte. Why, Monsieur, here
in this very caf&eacute;, once worked a negro boy.
He, being sick, I help him as a gentleman does
those negro, to be sure, and he was of heart
enough to thank me for that. So one day he
came to me and told me a story of a treasure
of a descendant of Lafitte. He himself, this
negro, had helped his master to bury that same
treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
&ldquo;And does he know the place now? Could he
point it out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, and the master who buried it
now is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why does not the negro boy go and
dig it up again, very naturally?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, for the best reasons. That old Frenchman,
descendant of Jean Lafitte, was no fool.
What does he in this burial of treasure? Ah!
He takes him a white parrot, a black cat and
a live monkey, and these three, all of them, he
buries on top of the treasure-box and covers
all with earth and grass above the earth. And
then above the grave he says such a malediction
upon any who may disturb it as would
alone frighten to the death any person coming
there and braving such a curse. I suggested
to the negro boy that he should show me the
spot. Monsieur, he grew pale in terror. Not
for a million pounds of solid gold would he go
near that place, him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That also is a most extraordinary story,
Jean. Taken with this other fairy tale which
you have told me to-night, you almost make me
feel that we are back in the great old days
which this country once saw. But alas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, Monsieur, alas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now as to that ruffian who stole the gentleman&rsquo;s
yacht,&rdquo; I resumed. &ldquo;Has he reflected?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
Has he indeed made his way to the Gulf? Why,
he might even be hiding here in the city somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, hardly that, and if so, he well may look
out for the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a sherbet would be excellent for the
lady now, Jean,&rdquo; I ventured, whereat he departed.
I turned over the paper and showed
Helena her own portrait on the front page,
four columns deep and set in such framing of
blackfaced scare type as made me blush for
my own sins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an adventure, Helena!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Had
you not been far the most beautiful woman in
this restaurant to-night, and had not Jean been
all eyes for you, he otherwise would have
looked at this paper rather than at you. Then
he would have looked at us both and must
have seen the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an adventure,&rdquo; said she slowly, her
color heightening; and later, &ldquo;You carried it
off well, Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bowed to her across the table. &ldquo;Need was
to act quickly, for even this vile newspaper
cut is a likeness of you. One glance from Jean,
which may come at any moment later, Helena,
and your parole will be needless further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess I wished to test you. It was
wrong, foolish of me, Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
&ldquo;You have been tested no less, Helena, to-night.
And I have found you a gentle high-born
lady, as I had always known you to be.
<i>Noblesse oblige</i>, my dear, and you have proved
it so to-night. Any time from now until twelve
you need no more than raise a finger&mdash;I might
not even see you do so&mdash;and you might go free.
Why do you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the woodcock is as good as the canvasback,&rdquo;
was her somewhat irrelevant reply, &ldquo;I
shall call the evening a success, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Helena scarcely more than tasted her
bird, and pushed back after a time the broiled
mushroom which Jean offered her gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does not your appetite remain?&rdquo; I inquired.
&ldquo;Come, you must not break Jean&rsquo;s heart
doubly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She only pushed back her chair. &ldquo;I am
sorry,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but I want to go back to
the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back to the boat! You astonish me. I
thought escape from the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> was the
one wish of your heart these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Helena, why not escape here and
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not mean for you to break your parole&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
know you too well for that. But give me
additional parole, my dear girl. Give me your
word. Say that one word. Then we can rise
here and announce to Mr. Davidson and all the
world and its newspapers that no crime has
been done and only a honeymoon has been
begun. Come, Helena, all the world loves a
lover. All New Orleans will love us if you
will raise your finger and say the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked toward her. Her head was bent
and tears were dropping from her eyes, tears
faithfully concealed by her kerchief. But she
said no word to me, and at her silence my own
heart sank&mdash;sank until my courage was quite
gone, until I felt the return of a cold brutality.
Still I endeavored to be gentle with one who
deserved naught of gentleness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not hurry, Helena,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We can
return when you like. But the salad&mdash;and the
coffee! And see, you have not touched your
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me back,&rdquo; she said, her voice low.
&ldquo;I hate you. Till the end of the world I&rsquo;ll hate
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could believe that, Helena, it would
matter nothing to me to go a mile farther on
any voyage, a foot farther to shield myself or
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
&ldquo;Take me back,&rdquo; she said to me again. &ldquo;I
want to go to Aunt Lucinda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean,&rdquo; said I, a moment later when he reappeared.
&ldquo;Mademoiselle wishes to see one
more ice-box in the kitchen. We are in search
of something. May we go again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean spread out his arms in surprise, but
pushed open the green door. We thus passed,
shielded by our screen and unobserved. Once
within, I grasped Jean firmly by the shoulder
and pressed a ten dollar bill into his hand, with
other money for the reckoning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this, Jean, for yourself. We do not
care to pass out at the front, for certain reasons&mdash;do
you comprehend? It is of Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of Mademoiselle? Ah, depend upon
me. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This. Leave us here, and we will walk
about. Meantime go out the back way to the
alley, Jean, and have a taxicab ready at the
mouth of the alley. Come quick when it is
arranged and let us go, because we must go at
once. At another time, Jean, we will return, I
trust more happily. Then we shall order such
a dinner as will take Luigi himself a day to
prepare, my friend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Madame, Jean, as I hope.&rdquo; And now I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
showed him the portrait on the front page of
the newspaper he had brought me. &ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and since you have been faithful, some
day I will explain all this to you&mdash;with Madame,
as I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE BURN ALL BRIDGES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;B</span>UT, Monsieur,&rdquo; began Jean, a few moments
later, as he entered from the alley
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien?</i> What then, Jean?&rdquo; I demanded
hastily, already leading Helena toward the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This! This!&rdquo; And he waved in my face a
copy of the same paper which had lain on our
table. &ldquo;The streets are full of it. And I see,
I behold&mdash;I recognize! It is Mademoiselle&mdash;that
is to be Madame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My face flushed hotly. &ldquo;As I hope, Jean.&rdquo;
That was all I said. &ldquo;Now, please, out of our
way. Is the taxi there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped aside. I heard his voice, eager,
apologetic, but knew that now no time must be
lost. Vague sounds of voices came to us from
the main room of the caf&eacute;, ordinarily so quiet.
I felt, rather than knew, that soon the news
would be about town. The throb of the taxi
was music to my ears when I found it in the
dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop for nothing,&rdquo; said I to the driver, as I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
closed the door. &ldquo;Slip K, on the river-front,
below the warehouses. Stop at the car tracks
where they turn. And go fast&mdash;I must catch
a boat that is just leaving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What boat&mdash;from there&mdash;are you sure, sir?&rdquo;
asked he, touching his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m sure. Go on! Don&rsquo;t stop
to talk, man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no answer to this, but turned to his
wheel. We shot out into Royal Street, turned
down it, spun into a narrow way past the old
Cathedral, crossed Jackson Square in the full
moonlight, passed the Old Market, and threaded
dark and dirty thoroughfares parallel to the
river. None sought to stay us, though many
paused in the gently squalid life of that section,
to look after our churning car, a thing not
usual there so far from depot or usual landing
place.</p>

<p>Helena sat silent, looking fixedly ahead
through the glass at the driver&rsquo;s back; nor did
I find words myself. In truth, I was as one
now carried forward on the wings of adventure
itself, with small plans, and no duty beyond
taking each situation as it might later come.
A dull feeling that I had sinned beyond forgiveness
came upon me, a conviction that my
brutality to one thus innocent and tender had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
passed all limits of atonement. She could never
forgive me now, I felt; and what was almost
as intolerable in the reflection, I could not forgive
myself, could not find any specious argument
longer to justify myself in thus harrying
the sensibilities of a woman such as this one
who now sat beside me in this mad midnight
errand, proud, pale and silent. Slowly I sought
to adjust myself to the thought of defeat, to
the feeling that my presumption now had o&rsquo;er-leaped
itself. Yes, I must say good-by to her,
must release her; and this time, as I well knew,
forever.</p>

<p>But, though I turned toward her half a dozen
times in these few minutes, she made no response
to what she must have known was my
demand upon her attention. I gathered her
gloves for her, and her flowers, but she only
took them, her lips parting in courtesy, not in
warmth, and no sound came to my ears, straining
always to hear her voice, a pleasant sound
in a world of discords ever. I even touched
her arm, suddenly, impulsively. &ldquo;Helena!&rdquo;
But she, not knowing that I meant to give her
liberty, though over a dead heart, shrank as
though I had added physical insult to my
verbal taunts. Anyway I turned, I was fast in
the net of circumstance, fanged by the springs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
of misapprehension.... Well, then, but one
thing remained. She had said it was a man&rsquo;s
place to fight, and so now it would be! I
must go on, and take my punishment until justice
had been done. Justice and my own success
I no longer confused in my own mind;
but in my soul was the grim resolution that
justice should first be done to one human soul,
even though that chanced to be my own. After
that, I should get her again in the hands of
her friends and myself; indeed, disappear beyond
all seeking, in parts of the world best
known to myself. If I myself were fair, why
should not fairness as well be given to me?</p>

<p>And with no more than this established, and
nothing definite in plan, either, for the present,
I mechanically opened the door of the taxi for
her when the driver pulled up and bent a
querying face about to ask whether or not we
now were opposite Slip K. I noted that he
did not at once drive away. Evidently he sat
for some moments gazing after us as we disappeared
in the gloom of the river-front. His
tale, as I afterward learned, enabled the morning
papers to print a conclusive story describing
the abduction of Miss Emory and her undoubted
retention on the stolen yacht, which,
after lying at or near New Orleans, some time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
that night, once more mysteriously had disappeared.</p>

<p>No doubt remained, according to this new
story, that the supplies put aboard at Slip K
by Lavallier and Thibodeau had gone to this
very craft, the stolen yacht! With this came
many wild and confusing accounts and descriptions,
including a passionate interview with Mr.
Calvin Davidson, of New York, who had announced
his intention of overhauling these ruffians,
at any cost whatsoever; and much counsel
to the city officials, mingled with the bosom-beating
of one enterprising journal which declared
it had put in commission a yacht of its
own, under charge of two of its ablest reporters,
who had instructions to take up the chase
and to remain out until the mystery had been
solved and this beautiful young woman had
been rescued from her horrible situation and
restored again to her home. There were more
portraits of Helena&mdash;furnished, most like, from
Cal Davidson&rsquo;s collection; one also of Aunt
Lucinda (from a photograph of far earlier
days); and lastly, a half-page portrait of myself,
the unnamed ruffian who was the undoubted
leader in this abduction&mdash;the portrait
being drawn by a staff artist &ldquo;from description
of eye-witnesses.&rdquo; As I later saw this portrait
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
I rejoiced that I was long ignorant of its existence:
and had I known that night that yonder
chauffeur to whom I had given undue
largess had such treason as that portrait in his
soul, I know not what I might have done with
him.</p>

<p>But of this misinformation, of course, I was
at the time ignorant, as was all the city ignorant
of the truth. What happened was otherwise,
nor was the truth learned even by the
great metropolitan journals of the North, which
now recognized the existence of a &ldquo;big story&rdquo;,
and added their keener noses to the trail. The
great fact overlooked by them all was that
they pursued no criminal, but a man of education,
I may fairly say of brains.</p>

<p>In my law practise many baffling cases came
to me, because I most liked, precisely, that sort
of case. Once, for instance, a family of my
town well-nigh was disrupted by a series of
anonymous letters, done in typewriting, accusing
an honorable man of dishonorable conduct.
The letters left the man&rsquo;s wife in an agony of
loyalty and suspicion alike. He brought me
the letters, and to me the case was simple from
the start. I got the repair slips of a certain
typewriter house, and compared them until I
found a machine with a bent letter M&mdash;knowing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
as I did that each machine has its own individuality
as ineradicable and as inescapable
as any personal handwriting. So at last I went
to a small outlying city, and going into a business
house there asked to see the stenographer
in private. &ldquo;My dear Miss&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; I said to her,
&ldquo;why do you persist in sending these letters
to Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; I laid them before her, and
she wept and confessed, very naturally.</p>

<p>That was merely jealousy of a discharged
employee; and it was easy as a case&mdash;easier
I always thought, than the probate case I won
over a contested signature charge filed by certain
heirs under a will. In this case I merely
went to the dead man&rsquo;s earlier home and
learned his history. Time out of mind he, a
thrifty and respected German, had held some
petty county office or other; and by going over
old county warrants and receipts signed in
forty years by my man, I discovered what I
already knew&mdash;that a man&rsquo;s signature changes
many times during his life, especially if he begins
life as an uncultured immigrant and advances
to a fair business success later in his
life: so that his later signatures on records
proved his signature in his will.</p>

<p>Again, liking these simple mysteries, I had
long ago learned to laugh at the old and foolish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
assertion that murder will out, that not the
most skilful criminal can long conceal a capital
crime. It is not true. No one knows how
many murders and other crimes go unsolved
or even unknown. The trouble with murderers,
as I knew well enough, was that they lacked
mentality. And often I said to myself that
were it in my heart to kill a man, I assuredly
could do so, and all my life escape unsuspected
of the crime.</p>

<p>It may be that my fondness for these less
obvious things in the law had rendered me a
trifle different from my fellow men. I could
never approach any question in life without
wanting to go all about it and to the bottom
and top, like a cooper with his barrel. I was
thus actuated, without doubt, in my relations
years since with Helena Emory&mdash;I knew the
shrewdness and accuracy of my own trained
mind. I confess I exulted in the infallible,
relentless logic of my mind, a mind able and
well trained, especially well trained in reason
and argument. So, when I put the one great
brief of all my life before Helena, my splendid
argument why should she love me, I did so,
at first, in the conviction that it must be convincing.
Had I not myself worked it out in
each detail, had not my calm, cool, accurate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
reason guarded each portal? Was it, indeed,
not a perfect brief&mdash;that one I held in my first
lost case&mdash;the lost case which sent me out of
my profession, left me a stranded hulk of a
man?</p>

<p>But then, when these two pirate youngsters
had found me and touched me with the living
point of some new flame of life, so that I knew
a vast world existed beyond the nature of the
intellect, the old ways clung to me, after all.
Even as I swore to lay hold on youth and on
adventure (and on love, if, in sooth, that might
be for me now), I could not fight as yet wholly
bare of the old weapons that had so long fitted
my hand. So, even on that very morning when
we set forth from my farm to be pirates, my
mind ran back to its old cunning, and I recalled
my earlier boast to myself that if I ever cared
to be a criminal I knew I could be able to cover
my tracks.</p>

<p>Those writing-folk, therefore, who now
wasted thousands of dollars in pursuit of trace
and trail of Black Bart, wealthy ex-lawyer,
knew nothing of their man, and guessed nothing
of his caliber or of his methods. They
even failed to look in plain sight for their trail
maker. And having done so, they forgot that
water leaves no trail. Yet that simple thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
had come to my mind as I had sat at breakfast
in my own house, some weeks before this
time! Even then I had planned all this.</p>

<p>Absorbed as I had been in this pursuit of
Helena, baffled as I had been by her, unhappy
as I now was over her own unhappiness, fierce
as was my love for her, still and notwithstanding,
some trace of my old self clung to me
even now when, her hand on my arm, I guided
Helena in silence over the creaking planks of
the dock, and saw, at last, dim beyond the
edge, the boom of the Mississippi&rsquo;s tawny flood,
rolling on and onward to the sea. Here was
a task, a problem, a chase, an endeavor, an
adventure! To it, I was impelled by my old
training; into it I was thrust by all these
fevers of the blood. Even though she did not
love me, she was woman ... in the dark air
of night, it seemed to me, I could smell the
faint maddening fragrance of her hair....
No. It was too late! I would not release
her. I would go on, now!</p>

<p>And with this resolution, formed when I
caught sight of the passing flood, I found a
sudden peace and calm, and so knew that I
was fit for my adventure as yon other boy,
L&rsquo;Olonnois, was for his.</p>

<p>I paused at the edge of the wharf, at the side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
of our boat. We still were arm in arm, still
silent, though she must have felt the beating
of my heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;yonder, one step,
and your parole is over. Here it is not. That
boat, just astern, is the one in which Cal Davidson
chased us all the way from Natchez, in
which I chased him all the way from Dubuque.
His men do not know we are here, nor does
he as yet. Now, what is it that you wish to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood silent for some time, tightening
her wrap at the throat against the river damp,
and made no answer, though her gaze took in
the dark hull of the low-lying craft made fast
below us. When at last:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I will not do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked. We spoke low, but
I well knew my men were aware of our coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall ask no favor of you.&rdquo; And as she
spoke, she stepped lightly on the rubbered deck
of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt! Who goes there?&rdquo; called the hoarse
voice of Jean Lafitte, the faithful: and I knew
the joy of the commander feeling that loyalty
is his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I, Black Bart,&rdquo; I answered, full and
clear. &ldquo;Cast off, my friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> was full of activity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
Peterson I met at the wheel. I heard the bells
jangle below. I saw Jean, active as a cat,
ready at the mooring-stub, waiting for the line
to ease. Then with my own hand I threw on
every light of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, so that she
blazed, in the power of six thousand candles,
search-light and all: so that what had been a
passing web of gloom now became a rippling
river. The warehouses started into light and
shade, the shadows of the wharf fled, the decks
of the grimy craft alongside became open of
all their secrets.</p>

<p>And now, revealed full in the flood of light
as she stood at the side portal, Helena did
what I had not planned. Freed of her parole
she was&mdash;and she had asked no favor of me&mdash;so
she had right to make attempt to escape;
and I gently stepped before her even as Jean
cast off and sprang aboard: and as I heard
L&rsquo;Olonnois&rsquo; voice imperatively demanding silence
of the pounding at the after cabin door.
All at once, I heard what Helena heard&mdash;the
rattle of wheels on the stone flagging of the
street beyond. And then I saw her fling back
her cloak and stand with cupped hands. Her
voice was high, clear and unwavering, such
voice as a pirate&rsquo;s bride should have, fearless
and bold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there! Help! Help!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
Some sort of shout came from the street, we
knew not from whom. A noise of an opening
hatch came from the <i>Sea Rover</i> at our stern,
and a man&rsquo;s tousled head came into view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on here,&rdquo; he demanded, as
quaveringly as querulously.</p>

<p>I made no answer, but saw our bows crawl
out and away, felt the sob of the screws, the
arm of the river also, and knew a vast and
pleasing content with life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;Olonnois!&rdquo; I called through the megaphone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; I heard his piping rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cast loose the stern-chaser and fire her at
yon varlet if he makes a move.&rdquo; I knew our
deck cannon was loaded with nothing more
deadly than newspapers, but I also knew that
valor feeds on action. Not that I had given
orders to fire on the world in general. So, I
confess, I was somewhat surprised, soon after
the shout of approval which greeted my command,
to hear the air rent by the astonishing
reverberation of our Long Tom, which rolled
like thunder all along the river-front, breaking
into a thousand echoes in the night.</p>

<p>I heard the patter of feet along the deck,
and had sight of Jean Lafitte tugging at a
halyard. Not content with our defiance of law
and order, he must needs break out the Jolly
Rover with its skull and cross-bones. And as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
we swung swiftly out into midstream, ablaze
in light from bow to stern, ghostlike in our
swiftness and the silence of our splendid engines,
I had reason to understand all the descriptive
writing which, as I later learned,
greeted the defiant departure of this pirate
craft and its ruffian crew. Thus I bade all the
world come and take from me what I had
taken for my own.</p>

<p>I stepped to the wheel with Peterson, expecting
to find him pale in consternation. To
my surprise he was calm, save for a new glitter
in his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing on the river can touch her,&rdquo;
said he, as he picked up his first channel light
and called for more speed. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden recklessness had caught us all, it
seemed, the old spirit of lawless man breaking
the leash of custom. I shared it&mdash;with exultation
I knew I shared it with these others. The
lust of youth for adventure held us all, and the
years were as naught.</p>

<p>I turned now to find Helena, and met L&rsquo;Olonnois,
his face beaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that a peach of a shot?&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;It would of blew yon varlet out of the water,
if I&rsquo;d had anything to load with except just
them marbles. Are you looking for Auntie
Helen? She has just went below.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE REACH THE SPANISH MAIN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was as Peterson had said&mdash;nothing on
the river could touch the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. And
it also was as I had not said but had thought&mdash;the
water left no trail. By daylight we were
far below the old battle-field, far below the old
forts, far below La Hache, and among the
channels of the great estuary whose marshes
spread for scores of miles on either hand impenetrably.
Quarantine lay yonder, the Southwest
Passage opened here; and on beyond, a
stone&rsquo;s throw now for a vessel logging our
smooth speed, rolled the open sea. And still
there rose behind us the smoke of no pursuing
craft, nor did any seek to bar our way. So far
as I knew, the country had not been warned
by any wire down-stream from the city. We
saw to it that no calling points were passed in
daylight. As for the chance market shooter
paddling his log pirogue to his shooting
ground in the dawn, or the occasional sportsman
of some ducking club likewise engaged,
they saluted us gaily enough, but without suspicion.
Even had they known, I doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
whether they would have informed on us, for
all the world loves a lover, and these Southerners
themselves now traveled waters long known
to adventure and romance.</p>

<p>So at last, as the sun rose, we saw the last
low marshy points widen, flatten and recede,
and beyond the outlying towers of the lights
caught sight of lazy liners crawling in, and
felt the long throb of the great Gulf&rsquo;s pulse,
and sniffed the salt of the open sea.</p>

<p>I had not slept, nor had Peterson, nor had
Williams, my engineer. My men never demurred
when hard duty was asked of them,
but put manly pride above union hours, I fancy,
resolved to show me they could endure as long
as I. And I asked none to endure more.
Moreover, even my pirate crew was seized of
some new zest. I question whether either Jean
Lafitte or Henri L&rsquo;Olonnois slept, save in his
day clothing, that night of our run from New
Orleans; for now, just as we swept free of the
last point, so that we might call that gulf
which but now had been river, I heard a sound
at my elbow as I bent over a chart, and turned
to see both my associates, the collars of their
sweaters turned up against the damp chill of
the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we now, Black Bart?&rdquo; asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
Jean Lafitte. I could see on his face the mystic
emotion of youth, could see his face glorified
in the uplifting thrill of this mystery of
the sea and the dawn and the unknown which
now enveloped us. &ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; he
asked; but it was as though he feared he slept
and dreamed, and that this wondrous dream of
the dawn might rudely be broken by some
command summoning him back to life&rsquo;s routine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely your soul should tell you, Jean Lafitte,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;for yonder, as I may say, now
rolls the Spanish Main. Its lift is now beneath
our feel. You are home again, Jean Lafitte.
Yonder are the bays and bayous and channels
in the marshes, where your boats used to hide.
And there, L&rsquo;Olonnois, my hearty, with you, I
was used to ride the open sea, toward the
Isles of Spain, waiting for the galleons to
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; said my blue-eyed pirate
softly and reverently; and so true was all his
note to that inner struggling soul that lay both
in his bosom and my own, that I ceased to
lament for my sin in so allowing modern youth
to be misled, and turned to him with open hand,
myself also young with the undying youth of
the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many a time, Black Bart,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
solemnly, &ldquo;have we crowded on full sail when
the lookout gave the word of a prize a-comin&rsquo;,
while we laid to in some hidden channel over
yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, many a time, many a time, my
hearty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;An&rsquo; loosed the bow-chaser an&rsquo; shot away
her foremast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;At almost the first shot, L&rsquo;Olonnois.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;So that her top hamper came down in a
run an&rsquo; swung her broadside to our batteries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And we poured in a hail of chain-shot and
set her hull afire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And then launched the boats for the
boardin&rsquo; parties,&rdquo; broke in Jean Lafitte, standing
on one leg in his excitement; &ldquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; so
made her a prize. An&rsquo; then we made &rsquo;em walk
the plank amid scenes of wassail&mdash;all but the
fair captives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I fell silent. But L&rsquo;Olonnois&rsquo; blue eyes were
glowing. &ldquo;An&rsquo; them we surrounded with every
rude luxury,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;finally retiring to the
fortresses of the hidden channels of the coast,
where we defied all pursuit. This looks like
one of them places, though I may be mistook,&rdquo;
he added judiciously. I shuddered to see how
Jimmy&rsquo;s grammar had deteriorated under my
care.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are now near to several
of those places, scenes of our bold deeds. The
south coast of Louisiana lies on our right, cut
by a thousand bays and channels deep enough
for hiding a pinnace or even a stout schooner.
Yonder, Jean, is Barataria Bay, your old home.
Here, under my finger, is C&ocirc;te Blanche. Here
comes the Chafalay, through its new channel&mdash;all
this floating hyacinth, all this red water,
comes from Texas soil, from the Red River,
now discharging in new mouths. Yonder, west
of the main boat channels that make toward
the railways far inland, lie the salt reefs and
the live-oak islands. Here is the long key they
now call Marsh Island. It was not an island
until you, stout Jean Lafitte, ordered the
Yankee Morrison to take a hundred black
slaves with spades and cut a channel across
the neck, so that you could get through more
quickly from the Spanish Main to the hidden
bayous where your boats lay concealed&mdash;until
the wagons from Iberia could come and traffic
at the causeway for your wares. Do you not
remember it well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, that I do, Black Bart!&rdquo; said he; and I
was sure he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yonder channel, once just wide enough
for a yawl, is to-day washed out wide enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
for a fleet to pass through&mdash;though not deep
enough. In that fact now lies our safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, Black Bart?&rdquo; demanded
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, that all this water over yonder west
of us is so shallow that it takes a wise oyster
boat to get through to Morgan City. The
shrimpers who reap these waters, even the
market shooting schooners who carry canvasbacks
out of these feeding beds in the marshes,
have to know the tides and the winds as well,
and if one be wrong the boat goes aground on
these wide shoals. Less than a fathom here
and here and here on the chart soundings&mdash;less
than that if an offshore wind blows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;ll go aground?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I mean that any pursuer very likely
would. The glass is falling now. Soon the
wind will rise. If it comes offshore for five
hours&mdash;and it will wait for five hours before
it does come offshore&mdash;we shall be safe, inside,
at one of your old haunts, Jean Lafitte; and
back of us will lie fifty miles of barrier&mdash;yon
varlet may well have a care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yon varlet don&rsquo;t know where we have
went,&rdquo; commented L&rsquo;Olonnois in his alarming
grammar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that is true. The water leaves no trail.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
Most Northerners go to Florida for the winter,
and not to these marshes. Methinks they will
have a long chase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; here,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte, with much enthusiasm,
&ldquo;we kin lie concealed an&rsquo; dart out
on passin&rsquo; craft that strike our fancy as prizes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but we will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; He seemed chilled by my reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we shall not need to,&rdquo; I hastened to
explain. &ldquo;We have everything we need for a
long stay here. We can live chiefly by hunting
and fishing for a month or so, until&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until the fair captive has gave her consent,&rdquo;
broke in L&rsquo;Olonnois, also with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, endeavoring a like enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Or, at least, until we find it needful to go
inland to one of the live-oak islands. There
are houses there. I know some of the planters
over yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make them places scenes of rapeen!&rdquo;
suggested Jean Lafitte anxiously. &ldquo;They must
have gold and jewels. Besides, I bear it well
in mind, many a time have I and my stout crew
buried chests of treasure on them islands. We
c&rsquo;d dig &rsquo;em up. Maybe them folks has a&rsquo;ready
dug &rsquo;em up. Then why not search their strongholds
with a stout party of our own hardy bullies,
Black Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I mildly; &ldquo;for several reasons I
think it best for my hardy bullies to go and eat
some breakfast and then go to sleep. If we
go into the live-oak heights above C&ocirc;te Blanche,
I think we&rsquo;ll only ask for salt. I am almost
sure, for instance, that my friend Edouard
Manning, of Bon Secours plantation, would give
me salt if I asked it. He has done so before.
Beshrew me, it should go hard with him if he
refused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a barrel an&rsquo; eight boxes o&rsquo; sacks o&rsquo;
salt aboard,&rdquo; said the practical Jean Lafitte.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you want so much salt for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas yon varlet&rsquo;s idea,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when he
laid in the ship&rsquo;s stores. But I had a mind
that, to my taste, no salt is better than that
made by the Manning plantation mines. But
now,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;to your breakfast, after you
have bathed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, after they had left me,
and pointing to the chart, &ldquo;lay her west by
south. I want to run inside the Timbalier
Shoals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very shallow there, Mr. Harry&mdash;just look
at the soundings, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I want to go. Hold on till
you get the light at this channel here, southeast
of the C&ocirc;te Blanche. You&rsquo;ll get a lot of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
floating hyacinth, but do what you can. I&rsquo;ll
take my trick, as soon as I get a bite to eat.
By night we&rsquo;ll be over our hurry and we can
all arrange for better sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;I&mdash;ahem! Mr. Harry, what are
your plans?&rdquo; He was just a trifle troubled
over all this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My plans, Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are to anchor
off Timbalier to-night, to anchor in this channel
of C&ocirc;te Blanche to-morrow&mdash;and to eat
breakfast now.&rdquo; Saying which I left him
gloomily shaking his head, but laying her now
west by south as I had made the course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The glass is falling mighty fast, Mr. Harry,&rdquo;
he called over his shoulder to me by way of
encouragement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS CERTAIN POLITE CONVERSATION</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y boy had ironed my trousers, that is to
say, the trousers I had given him the year
previous, and which he now had loaned to me,
my extremity being greater than his own. He
had laundered my collars&mdash;a most useful boy,
my China boy. I had, moreover, delving in
Cal Davidson&rsquo;s wardrobe, discovered yet another
waistcoat, if possible more radiant even
than the one with pink stripes, for that it was
cross hatched with bars of pale pea green and
mauve&mdash;I know not from what looms he obtained
these wondrous fabrics. Thus bravely
attired after breakfast, just before luncheon,
indeed, it was, I felt emboldened to call upon
the captive ladies once more. With much
shame I owned that I had not seen Auntie
Lucinda for nearly two days&mdash;and with much
trepidation, also, for I knew not what new bitterness
her soul, meantime, might have distilled
into venom against my coming.</p>

<p>I knocked at the door of the ladies&rsquo; cabin,
the aftermost suite on the boat, and, at first,
had no answer. The door, naturally, on a boat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
of this size, would be low, the roof rising above
decks no higher than one&rsquo;s waist; and as I bent
to knock again, the door of the companion
stairs was suddenly thrust open against my
face, and framed in the opening thus made,
there appeared the august visage of Auntie
Lucinda herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir-r-r-r!&rdquo; said she, after a time, regarding
me sternly. I can by no means reproduce
the awfulness of her &ldquo;r&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam?&rdquo; I replied mildly, holding my
nose, which had been smitten by the door.</p>

<p>She made no answer, but stood, a basilisk
in mien.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just came, my dear Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo; I began,
&ldquo;to ask you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And time you did, sir-r-r-r! I was just coming
to ask <em>you</em>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And time you did, my dear Mrs. Daniver&mdash;I
have missed you so much, these several days.
So I just called to ask for your health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not trouble about my health!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do, I do, madam! I give you my
word, I was awake all night, thinking of&mdash;of
your neuralgia. Neuralgia is something&mdash;something
fierce, in a manner of speech&mdash;if one
has it in the morning, my dear Mrs. Daniver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;dear Mrs. Daniver&rsquo; me! I&rsquo;m not
your dear Mrs. Daniver at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then whose dear Mrs. Daniver are you, my
dear Mrs. Daniver?&rdquo; I rejoined most impudently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the poor dear Admiral were alive,&rdquo; said
she, sniffing, &ldquo;you should repent those words!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the poor dear Admiral were here,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I should like to ask an abler sailorman
than Peterson what to do, with the glass
falling as it is, and the holding ground none
too good for an anchor. I thought it just as
well to come and tell you to prepare for the
worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; She now
advanced three steps upward, so that her shoulders
were above the cabin door. Almost mechanically
she took my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst just now is nothing worse than
an orange with ice, my dear Mrs. Daniver.
And I only wanted you to come out on deck
with&mdash;Miss Emory&mdash;and see how blue the sea
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She advanced another step, being fond of an
iced orange at eleven-thirty. But now she
paused. &ldquo;My niece is resting,&rdquo; said she, feeling
her way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; I heard a voice say. Inadvertently
I turned and almost perforce glanced
down the cabin stair. Helena, in a loose morning
wrap of pink, was lying on the couch. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
now cast aside the covering of eider-down,
and shaking herself once, sprang up the stairs,
so that her dark hair appeared under Auntie
Lucinda&rsquo;s own. Slowly that obstacle yielded,
and both finally stood on the after deck. The
soft wind caught the dark tendrils of Helena&rsquo;s
hair. With one hand she pushed at them. The
other caught her loose robe about her softly
outlined figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helena!&rdquo; remarked her aunt, frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want an orange,&rdquo; remarked Miss Emory,
addressing the impartial universe, and looking
about for John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall have it. But,&rdquo; said I, finding a
soft rug at the cabin-top, &ldquo;I think perhaps you
may find the air cool. Allow me.&rdquo; I handed
them chairs, and with a hand that trembled a
bit put the soft covering over Helena&rsquo;s shoulders.
She drew it close about her with one
hand, and her dark hair flowing about her
cheeks, found her orange with the other when
John came with his tray.</p>

<p>It was a wondrous morning in early fall.
Never had a southern sky been more blue,
never the little curling waves saucier on the
Gulf. The air was mild, just fresh enough for
zest. Around us circled many great white
gulls. Across the flats sailed a long slow line
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
of pelicans; and out yonder, tossing up now
and then like a black floating blanket, I could
see a great raft of wild duck, taking their midday
rest in safety. All the world seemed a
million miles away. Care did not exist. And&mdash;so
intimate and swiftly comprehensive is the
human soul, especially the more primal soul
of woman&mdash;already and without words, this
young woman seemed to feel the less need of
conversation, to recognize the slackening rein
of custom. So that a rug and a wrapper&mdash;granted
always also an aunt&mdash;seemed to her
not amiss as full equipment for reception of a
morning caller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very good orange,&rdquo; said she at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her aunt promptly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we
ought to thank Mr. Davidson for them. He
was <em>such</em> a good provider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except in waistcoats,&rdquo; I protested, casually
indicating his latest contribution to my wardrobe.
&ldquo;Quantity, yes, I grant that, but as to
quality, never! But why speak ill of the absent,
especially regarding matters of an earlier and
bygone day? Yon varlet no longer exists for
us&mdash;we no longer exist for him. We have
passed, as two ships pass yonder in the channel.
I know not what he may be doing now,
unless carrying roses to Miss Sally Byington.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
Certainly he can not know that I, his hated
rival, am safe from all pursuit behind the
Timbalier Shoals, and carrying oranges to a
young lady in my belief almost as beautiful as
the beautiful Sally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aunt Lucinda turned upon me a baleful eye.
&ldquo;You grow flippant as well as rude, sir! As
though you knew anything of that Byington
girl. I doubt if you ever saw her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;last night. Miss Emory and I
both saw her, last night, at Luigi&rsquo;s. As for
yon varlet&rsquo;s providing, while I would not too
much criticize a man whose waistcoats I wear
even under protest, it is but fair to say that
these oranges and all the fresh things taken on
at New Orleans, are of my providing, and not
his. He was so busy providing other things
for Miss Sally Byington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is so beautiful,&rdquo; said
Helena, ceasing with her orange. &ldquo;Her color
is so full. Very likely she&rsquo;ll be blowsy in a
few years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you say so!&rdquo; I rebuked, with
much virtuous indignation. But at the time I
felt my heart leap at sight of Helena herself,
the lines of her slim graceful figure defined
even under the rug she had drawn about her
neck, the wind-blown little neck curls and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
long fuller lock now plain against her fresh
face, blown pale by the cool salt air that sang
above us gently. I could no longer even feign
an interest in any other woman in the world.
So very unconsciously I chuckled to myself,
and Helena heard me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so yourself!&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she is so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not. Not as beautiful as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the funny bird!&rdquo; said Helena suddenly.
Yet I could see nothing out of the ordinary
in the sea-bird she pointed out, skimming
and skipping close by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; demanded Aunt Lucinda, also suddenly,
&ldquo;how long is this to last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the orange-dish, Mrs. Daniver?&rdquo;
I queried politely. &ldquo;As long as you like. I
also am a good provider, although to no credit,
as it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I do not mean the oranges, sir.
I mean this whole foolish business. You are
putting yourself liable to the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did Jean Lafitte, over yonder in Barataria,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but he lived to a ripe old age
and became famous. Why not I as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;You are ruining those two boys. I weep
to think of our poor Jimmy&mdash;why, he lords it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
about as though he owned the boat. And
such language!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall own a part of her if he likes, if
all comes out well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And as for Jean
Lafitte, Junior, rarely have I seen a boy of
better judgment, cooler mind, or more talent
in machinery. He shall have an education, if
he likes; and I know he will like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful what a waistcoat will do
for the imagination,&rdquo; remarked Helena, wholly
casually. I turned to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume it is Mr. Davidson who is to be
the fairy prince,&rdquo; added Aunt Lucinda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, myself,&rdquo; I spoke quietly. Aunt Lucinda
for once was almost too unmistakable in her
sniff of scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit it seems unlikely,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Still,
this is a wonderful age. Who can say what
may be gained by the successful pirate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You act one!&rdquo; commented Aunt Lucinda.
&ldquo;It is brutal. It is outrageous. It is abominable.
No gentleman would be guilty of such
conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grant you,&rdquo; said I, but flushed under the
thrust. &ldquo;But I am no longer a gentleman
where that conflicts with the purpose of my
piracy. I come of a family, after all, madam,
who often have had their way in piracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
&ldquo;And left a good useful business to go away
to idleness! And now speak of doing large
things! With whose money, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very direct, my dear Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo;
said I mildly, &ldquo;but the catechism is not
yet so far along as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you do this crazy thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To marry Helena, and with your free consent
as her next friend,&rdquo; said I, swiftly turning
to her. &ldquo;Since I must be equally frank. Please
don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; I said to Helena, for now, very pale,
she was starting toward the cabin door. But
she paid no heed to me, and passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So now you have it, plainly,&rdquo; said I to Mrs.
Daniver.</p>

<p>She turned on me a face full of surprise and
anger mingled. &ldquo;How dare you, after all that
has passed? You left the girl years ago. You
have no business, no fortune, not even the girl&rsquo;s
consent. I&rsquo;ll not have it! I love her.&rdquo; The
good woman&rsquo;s lips trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said I gently. &ldquo;That is why we
all are here. It is because of this madness
called love. Ah, Mrs. Daniver, if you only
knew! If I could make you know! But surely
you do know, you, too, have loved. Come,
may you not love a lover, even one like myself?
I&rsquo;ll be good to Helena. Believe me, she is my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
one sacred charge in life. I love her. Not
worthy of her, no&mdash;but I love her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo; But I saw her face relent
at what she heard. &ldquo;I have other plans.
And you should have told her what you have
told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, have I not?&rdquo; But then I suddenly remembered
that, by some reversal of my logical
mind, here I was, making love to Auntie Lucinda,
whom I did not love, whereas in the
past I had spent much time in mere arguing
with Helena, whom I did love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ve ever made it plain
enough to her, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said I slowly. &ldquo;But
if she gives me the chance, I&rsquo;ll spend all my
life telling her that very thing. That, since
you ask me, is why we all are here&mdash;so that I
may tell Helena, and you, and all the world,
that very thing. I love her, very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose she does not love you?&rdquo; demanded
Mrs. Daniver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say frankly, I&rsquo;ve
advised her against you all along. She ought
to marry a man of some station in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put it baldly, but&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that be enough&mdash;money?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. That is not fair&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Only honor between us now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
&ldquo;It would go for to-day. Because, after all,
money means power, and all of us worship
power, you know&mdash;success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is that success&mdash;to have money, and
then more money&mdash;and to go on, piling up
more money&mdash;to have more summer places,
and more yachts like this, and more city houses,
and more money, money, money&mdash;yes, yes,
that&rsquo;s American, but is it all, is it right, is it
the real ambition for a man! And does that
bring a woman happiness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you do if you had your money
back?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Daniver. &ldquo;You had a fortune
from your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would I do?&rdquo; I rejoined hotly.
&ldquo;What I did do&mdash;settle every claim against his
honor as much as against his estate&mdash;judge his
honor by my own standards, and not his. Pay
my debts&mdash;pay all my debts. It&rsquo;s independence,
madam, and not money that I want. It&rsquo;s freedom,
Mrs. Daniver, that I want, and not money.
So far as it would be the usual money, buying
almost nothing that is worth owning, I give
you my solemn oath I don&rsquo;t care enough for it
to work for it! So far as it would help me
be a man, help me to build my own character,
help me build manhood and character in my
country&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;d like it for that. But if money
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
were the price of Helena herself, I&rsquo;d not ask
for it. The man who would court a girl with
his money and not his manhood&mdash;the woman
who marries for money, or the man who does&mdash;what
use has God Almighty got for either
of them? It&rsquo;s men and women and things
worth doing who make this world, Mrs. Daniver.
I love her, so much, so clearly, so wholly,
that I think it must be right. And since you&rsquo;ve
asked me, I&rsquo;ve taken my man&rsquo;s chance, just to
get you two alone, where I could talk it over
with you both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been talked over, Harry,&rdquo; said she,
rather uncomfortably. &ldquo;Why not let the poor
child alone? Has it occurred to you how terribly
hard this is for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But she can end it easily. Tell me,
is she engaged to Davidson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What difference?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why ask, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, no, not so far as I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sorry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had hope for it. It was all coming on so
handsomely. At Natchez he was&mdash;he was,
well, you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost upon the point?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
&ldquo;Quite so. I thought, I believed that between
there and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say between there and Baton Rouge&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would come to the main point?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he did not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can best answer. It was at Natchez
that you and those ruffianly boys ran off with
Mr. Davidson&rsquo;s boat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, your Honor,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;Take
the witness, Mr. Davidson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what right you have to cross-question
me, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; commented Mrs. Daniver,
addressing a passing sea-gull, and pulling down
the corners of her mouth most forbiddingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My disused and forgotten art comes back
to me once in a while, my dear Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo;
I answered exultantly. &ldquo;Pray, do you notice
how beautiful all the world is this morning?
The sky is so wonderful, the sea so adorable,
don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that we are a long way from home.
Tell me, are these sharks here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oodles,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and very large. No use
trying to swim away. And yonder coast is
inhabited only by hostile cannibals. Barataria itself,
over yonder, is to-day no more than a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
shrimp-fishing village, part Chinese, part Greek
and part Sicilian. The railway runs far to the
north, and the ship channel is far to the east.
No one comes here. It is days to Galveston,
westward, and between lies a maze of interlocking
channels, lakes and bayous, where boats
once hid and may hide again. Once we unship
our flag mast, and we shall lie so saucy and
close that behind a bank of rushes we never
would be seen. And we do not burn coal, and
so make no smoke. Here is my chosen hiding
ground. In short, madam, you are in my
power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But really, how far&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you ask, I will answer. Yonder, to
the westward, a bayou comes into C&ocirc;te Blanche.
Follow that bayou, eighty miles from here,
and you come to the house of my friend,
Edouard Manning, the kindest man in Louisiana,
which is to say much. I had planned to
have the wedding there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your effrontery amazes me&mdash;I doubt your
sanity!&rdquo; said Aunt Lucinda, horrified. &ldquo;But
what good will all this do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had a certain bravery all her own, after
all. Almost, I was on the point of telling her
the truth; which was that I had during the
long night resolved once more to offer my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>
hand to Helena, and if she now refused me, to
accept my fate. I would torture her no more.
No, if now she were still resolute, it was my
purpose to sail up yonder bayou, to land at
the Manning plantation, and there to part forever
from Helena and all my friends. I knew
corners of the world far enough that none
might find me.</p>

<p>But I did not tell Aunt Lucinda this. Instead,
I made no answer; and we both sat looking
out over the rippling gulf, silent for some
time. I noted now a faint haze on the horizon
inshore, like distant cloud-banks, not yet distinct
but advancing. Aunt Lucinda, it seemed,
was watching something else through the ship&rsquo;s
glasses which she had picked up near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that, over yonder?&rdquo; asked she&mdash;&ldquo;it
looks like a wreck of some kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a wreck&mdash;that of a lighthouse,&rdquo; I told
her. &ldquo;It is lying flat on its side, a poor attitude
for a lighthouse. The great tidal wave
of the gulf storm, four years ago, destroyed it.
We are now, to tell the truth, at the edge of
that district which causes the Weather Bureau
much uncertainty&mdash;a breeding ground of the
tropical cyclones that break between the Indies
and this coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you bring us here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
&ldquo;Only to pass to the inner channels, madam,
where we should be safer in case of storm.
To-night, we shall anchor in the lee of a long
island, where the lighthouse is still standing, in
its proper position, and where we shall be safe
as a church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharks! Storms! Shipwrecks!&rdquo; moaned
she.</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;And pirates,&rdquo; added I gently, &ldquo;and cannibals.
Yes, madam, your plight is serious, and
I know not what may come of it all&mdash;I wish
I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no good will come of it, one thing
sure,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucinda, preparing to weep.</p>

<p>And indeed, an instant later, my mournful
skipper seemed to bear her out. I saw Peterson
standing expectant, a little forward, now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Peterson?&rdquo; I rose and went to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, sir, Mr. Harry,&rdquo; said he
somewhat anxiously, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve bent her port
shaft on a cursed oyster reef.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Peterson. Suppose we run with
the starboard screw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the intake&rsquo;s clogged again with this
cursed fine sand we&rsquo;ve picked up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After I warned Williams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And that&rsquo;s not the worst, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed? You must be happy, Peterson!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t log over eight knots now, and it&rsquo;s
sixty miles to our light back of the big key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent, Peterson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the glass is falling mighty fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the best
thing you can do is to hold your course, and
the best thing I can do is to get ready for
lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing either of us can do is to get
some sleep,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for we may not get
much to-night. She&rsquo;ll break somewhere after sunset
to-night, very likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us hope for the
worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the same, I did not wholly like the look
of things, for I had seen these swift gulf
storms before. A sudden sinking of the heart
came over me. What if my madness, indeed,
should come to mean peril to her? Swiftly I
stepped back to the door of the ladies&rsquo; cabin,
where Mrs. Daniver now disappeared. &ldquo;Helena!&rdquo;
I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I heard her answer as she stepped
toward the little stair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;?&rdquo; I rejoined suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not! I only meant to ask what
you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As though you did not know! I wanted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
only to call you to get ready for luncheon.
One of the owners of this waistcoat has provided
a pompano, not to mention some excellent
endive. And the weather is fine, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS SHIPWRECK</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T must be understood that our party on the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> was divided into two, or
rather, indeed, three camps, each somewhat
sharply defined and each somewhat ignorant
of the other&rsquo;s doings in detail. The combination
of either two against the other, in organized
mutiny, might very well prove successful,
wherefore it was my task to keep all apart by
virtue of the authority which I had myself
usurped. The midship&rsquo;s cabin suite, of three
rooms, was occupied by myself and my two
bold young mates&mdash;when the latter were not
elsewhere engaged. We made what might be
called the ruling classes. Forward of our cabin,
and accessible only from the deck, was the
engine-room where Williams worked, and off
this were two bunks, well ventilated and very
comfortable, occupied by Williams and Peterson.
Forward of this, and also accessible only
from the deck, lay the dining saloon, with its
fixed table, its cupboards, dish racks and wine-room.
In her bows and below the saloon was
the cook&rsquo;s gallery, a dumb-waiter running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
between; and the sleeping quarters of John, the
cook, and Willy, the deck-hand, were in the
forecastle below. This left the two captives
all the after part of the ship pretty much to
themselves, and as the after-suite of cabins was
roomy and fitted with every modern nautical
luxury, they lacked neither freedom nor comfort,
so far as these may obtain on shipboard.
Obviously, I said little to the ship&rsquo;s crew, except
to Peterson, and my two mates had orders
to keep to their own part of the ship, under my
eye.</p>

<p>Thus, like ancient Gaul, divided into three
parts, we sailed on our wholly indefinite voyage;
and all I could do was to live from day
to day, or hour to hour. I was content, for
Helena was there. Indeed, I question if, these
last three years, her image had not been always
present in my consciousness; such are the
fevers of our unreasoning blood, such the power
of that madness known as love.</p>

<p>But, thus divided as was our company, I had
none such excellent opportunity for often seeing
Helena, as might at first be supposed. She
and her aunt refused to join us at any meal in
the dining saloon; although, now and then,
they came for breakfast to what Auntie Lucinda
with scorn called the &ldquo;second table&rdquo;. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
was not feasible for me, often, to do more than
call of a morning to inquire if all was well
with them; and conversation through a lead-glass
transom is not what one would call intimate.
Helena could bar her door if she liked
in more ways than one; and against the fences
that she raised against me one way or another,
what with headaches, whims or Aunt Lucinda,
I had now no chance to meet her alone save
as she herself might dictate. So that, after
all, though now I stood as commander of the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> in place of yon varlet, Cal Davidson,
although I ate his ship&rsquo;s stores, wore, indeed,
his waistcoats and his neckties when that
was humanly possible, I was his successor only
and not his equal. He could&mdash;nay, had done
so&mdash;meet Helena as he liked, at meals, on deck,
on a thousand errands, whereas I was helpless
to do so. He could talk with her all over the
ship, take her alone on deck of a moonlit night,
listen to her sing, gaze&mdash;oh, curse him!&mdash;on
the little curls on Helena&rsquo;s neck&mdash;but no! I
could not endure that thought. The round
white neck, the white shoulders, the soft curves
beneath the peignoir&rsquo;s careless irreverences&mdash;why,
it was an intolerable thought that any
man should raise eye or heart or thought to
Helena, save myself. So, this morning, after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
that rare and unconventional meeting on the
after deck, one easily may see how much I
wished all Gaul were divided into but two parts,
and that the occupants of the reserved after
cabin would come to lunch in the saloon with
their captors, Black Bart, Jean Lafitte and Henri
L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>Now, &rsquo;tis an odd thing, but one of my superstitions,
that when we wish much and fervently
and cleanly for any certain thing, one day that
thing is ours. Some day, some time, some
hour or instant, our dear desire, our coveted
thing, our wish, comes and flutters and alights
at our side; if really we have deserved it and
have wished long and deeply and honestly and
purposefully. You ask proof? Well, then,
hardly had we three, Black Bart, Jean Lafitte
and Henri L&rsquo;Olonnois, seated ourselves at table
for luncheon that day before I became sensible
of a faint shadow at the saloon stair. I saw a
trim boot and a substantial ankle which I knew
belonged to Aunt Lucinda; and then I looked
up and saw on the deck Helena also, stooped,
her clean-cut head, with its blown dark hair,
visible against the blue sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; she asked gaily enough.
And I reached up next to her to hand her
down, and smooth down her skirt for her at
the rather awkward narrow stair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are always invited,&rdquo; said I, and perhaps
I flushed in my pleasure. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; I called
down the tube, &ldquo;two more&mdash;the ladies.&rdquo; And
I heard his calm &ldquo;All lite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My young gentlemen had risen, politely, but
Helena gently pushed them down into their
places. &ldquo;Be seated here, ladies,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;These
places are, as you see, always spread for you.
Your covers wait. And all the ship&rsquo;s silver
shall see duty now. L&rsquo;Olonnois, my hearty,
you and I shall serve, eh? I am, indeed, delighted&mdash;greatly
delighted&mdash;I shall not inquire, I
shall only hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; boomed the deep voice of Auntie
Lucinda, &ldquo;we came because we did not like the
look of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, things are not looking bully,&rdquo;
I assented vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the weather. It&rsquo;s getting black, and
it&rsquo;s colder. And after what you told me about
the storms, and that lighthouse being blown
down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo; said I, helping her
to her chair while L&rsquo;Olonnois served his Auntie
Helena in like fashion, &ldquo;you really must not
take one too seriously. That lighthouse fell
over of its own weight&mdash;the contractor&rsquo;s work
was done shamefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said it blew,&rdquo; ventured Helena.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
&ldquo;It blows, a little, now and then, to be sure,
but never very much, only enough to enable
the oyster boats and shrimpers to get in. How
could we have oysters without a sailing
breeze?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than a breeze,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucinda.
&ldquo;My neuralgia tells me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate that you honored us, my dear
Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I have here in the
cooler a bottle of ninety-three. I had an inspiration.
I knew you would come, for nothing in the
world could have pleased me so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was looking at Helena, whose eyes were
cast down. I observed now that she was in
somewhat elegant morning costume, her bridge
coat of Vienna lace, caught with a wide bar
of plain gold, covering some soft and shimmering
under-bodice which fitted closely
enough to be formal. And I saw she had on
many rings, and that her throat sparkled under
a circlet of gems.</p>

<p>She must have caught my glance of surprise,
for she said nervously, &ldquo;You think we are
overplaying our return call? Well, the truth
is, we&rsquo;re afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So then?&rdquo;&mdash;and I bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So then I fished out all my jewelry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are honored.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know what might happen.
If one should be shipwrecked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I caught
her frightened gaze out an open port, perfectly
aware myself of the swift weather change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing like dressing the part of
the shipwrecked,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;For myself, these
same flannels will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said young L&rsquo;Olonnois, &ldquo;suppose
she does pitch a little&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t any worse&rsquo;n on
the <i>Mauretania</i> when we went across. I ain&rsquo;t
scared, are you, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jean Lafitte shyly. He was
almost overawed with the ladies. But I liked
the look of his eye now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not as big as the <i>Mauretania</i>,&rdquo; said Helena,
fixing L&rsquo;Olonnois&rsquo; collar for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s going to roll horribly,&rdquo; added
Aunt Lucinda. &ldquo;And if I should be seasick,
with my neuralgia, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what
I should do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> know!&rdquo; remarked L&rsquo;Olonnois; and Helena
promptly dropped her hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us not think of storm and shipwreck,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;at least until they come. I want to ask
your attention to John&rsquo;s imitation of Luigi&rsquo;s
oysters <i>&agrave; la marini&egrave;re</i>. The oysters are of our
own catching this morning. For, you must know,
the water hereabout is very shallow, and is full of
oysters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
&ldquo;You said full of sharks,&rdquo; corrected Aunt
Lucinda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I? I meant oysters.&rdquo; And I helped
her to some from the dumb-waiter and uncorked
the very last bottle of the ninety-three left in
the case. &ldquo;And as for this storm of which you
speak, ladies,&rdquo; I added as I poured, &ldquo;I would
there might come every day as ill a wind if
it would blow me as great a good as yourselves
for luncheon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois brightly, &ldquo;you might
blow in once in a while an&rsquo; see us fellers. I
told Black Bart that captives&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but here I
kicked Jimmy under the table. Poor chap,
what with his Auntie Helena&rsquo;s hand at one
extremity and my boot at the other, he was
strained in his conversation, and in disgust,
joined Jean Lafitte in complete silence and oysters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; and Helena raised her eyes, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
it growing colder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean, close the port behind Miss Emory,&rdquo;
said I. It was plain enough to my mind that
a blue norther was breaking, with its swift
drop in temperature and its possibly high wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The table&rsquo;s actin&rsquo; funny,&rdquo; commented Jean
Lafitte presently. He had never been at sea
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Lucinda, with very much&mdash;too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
much&mdash;dignity. &ldquo;If you all will please
excuse me, I think I shall go back to the cabin.
Helena!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go with Mrs. Daniver at once, Jimmy,&rdquo;
said I to L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, Sir!&rdquo; saluted he joyously; and
added aside as he passed me, &ldquo;Hope the old
girl&rsquo;s going to be good an&rsquo; sick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see Peterson standing near the saloon&rsquo;s
door, and bethought me to send Jean
Lafitte up to aid him in making all shipshape.
We were beginning to roll; and I missed the
smooth thrust of both our propellors, although
now the engines were purring smoothly
enough. Thus by mere chance, I found myself
alone with Helena. I put out a hand to steady
her as she rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it really going to be bad?&rdquo; she inquired
anxiously. &ldquo;Auntie gets <em>so</em> sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be rough, for three hours yet,&rdquo; I
admitted. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not so big as the <i>Mauretania</i>,
but as well built for her tonnage. You couldn&rsquo;t
pound her apart, no matter what came&mdash;she&rsquo;s
oak and cedar, through and through, and every
point&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve studied her well, since you&mdash;since
you came aboard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, yes, to be sure I have. And she&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
worth her name. Don&rsquo;t you think it was
mighty fine of&mdash;of Mr. Davidson to name her
after you&mdash;the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never did. If he had, why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask such questions, with the glass
falling as it is,&rdquo; I said, pulling up the racks to
restrain the dancing tumblers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t joke!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Helena,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But we seem so little and
the sea so big. And it&rsquo;s getting black, and the
fog is coming. Look&mdash;you can&rsquo;t see the shore-line
any more now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as she said. The swift bank of vapor
had blotted out the low-lying shores entirely.
We sailed now in a narrowing circle of mist.
I saw thin points of moisture on the port
lights. And now I began to close the ports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There <em>is</em> danger!&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All horses can run away, all auto cars can
blow up, all boats can sink. But we have as
good charts and compasses as the <i>Mauretania</i>, and
in three hours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But much can happen in three hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much has happened in less time. It did
not take me so long as that to love you, Helena,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
and that I have not forgotten in more than
five years. Five years, Helena. And as to
shipwreck, what does one more matter? It is
you who have made shipwreck of a man&rsquo;s life.
Take shame for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take shame yourself, to talk in this way to
me, when I am helpless, when I can&rsquo;t get
away, when I&rsquo;m troubled and frightened half
to death? Ah, fine of you to persecute a
girl!&rdquo; She sobbed, choking a little, but her
head high. &ldquo;Let me out, I&rsquo;m going to Auntie
Lucinda. I hate you more and more. If I
were to drown, I&rsquo;d not take aid from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that, Helena?&rdquo; I asked, more
than the chill of the norther in my blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean it. You are a <em>coward</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood for quite a time between her and
the companion stair, my hand still offering aid
as she swayed in the boat&rsquo;s roll now. I was
thinking, and I was very sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perhaps you have won.
That&rsquo;s a hard word to take from man or
woman. If it is in any way true, you have
won and I have lost, and deserved to lose. But
now, since little else remains, let me arrange
matters as simply as I can. I&rsquo;ll admit there&rsquo;s
an element of risk in our situation&mdash;one screw
is out of commission, and one engine might be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
better. If we missed the channel west of the
shoals, we might go aground&mdash;I hope not.
Whether we do or not, I want to tell you&mdash;over
yonder, forty or fifty miles, is the channel
running inland, which was my objective
point all along. I know this coast in the dark,
like a book. Now, I promise you, I&rsquo;ll take you
in there to friends of mine, people of your own
class, and no one shall suspect one jot of all
this, other than that we were driven out of
our course. And once there, you are free. You
never will see my face again. I will do this,
as a ship&rsquo;s man, for you, and if need comes,
will give my life to keep you safe. It&rsquo;s about
all a coward can do for you. Now go, and if
any time of need comes for me to call you,
you will be called. And you will be cared for
by the ship&rsquo;s men. And because I am head of
the ship&rsquo;s men, you will do as I say. But I
hope no need for this will come. Yonder is
our course, where she heads now, and soon
you will be free from me. You have wrecked
me. Now I am derelict, from this time on.
Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard footfalls above. &ldquo;Mrs. Daniver&rsquo;s
compliments to Captain Black Bart,&rdquo; saluted
L&rsquo;Olonnois, &ldquo;an&rsquo; would he send my Auntie Helena
back, because she&rsquo;s offle sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
&ldquo;Take good care of your Auntie Helena,
Jimmy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and help her aft along the
rail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I followed up the companionway, and saw
her going slowly, head down, her coat of lace
blown wide; her hand at her throat, and sobbing
in what Jimmy and I both knew was fear
of the storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they got everything they need there,
Jimmy?&rdquo; I asked, as he returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. And the old girl&rsquo;s going to have a
peach of a one this time&mdash;she can&rsquo;t hardly rock
in a rockin&rsquo; chair &rsquo;thout gettin&rsquo; seasick. I
think it&rsquo;s great, don&rsquo;t you? Look at her buck
into &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy and his friend shared this immunity
from <i>mal de mer</i>. I could see Jean now helping
haul down our burgee, and the deck boy, Willy,
in his hurried work about the boat. Williams,
I could not see. But Peterson was now calm
and much in his element, for a better skipper
than he never sailed a craft on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s going to blow great guns,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and like enough the other engine&rsquo;ll
pop any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I answered, stepping to the wheel.
&ldquo;In which case we go to Davy Jones about
when, Peterson?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the
grandest little ship afloat, and not a thing&rsquo;s
the matter with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we make the channel and run inside
the long key below the C&ocirc;te Blanche Bayou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we can. You&rsquo;d better get the covers
off the boats, and see the bottom plugs in and
some water and supplies shipped aboard&mdash;but
there&rsquo;s not the slightest danger in the world
for <em>this</em> boat, let me tell you that, sir. I&rsquo;ve
seen her perform before now, and there&rsquo;s not
a storm can blow on this coast she won&rsquo;t ride
through.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS SHIPWRECK OF OTHER SORT</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER the fashion of these gulf storms,
this one tarried not in its coming, nor offered
any clemency when it had arrived. Where
but a half-hour since the heavens had been
fair, the sea rippling, suave and kind, now the
sky was not visible at all and the tumbling
waves about us rolled savagely as in a nature
wholly changed. The wind sang ominously
overhead, as with lift and plunge we drove on
into a bank of mist. A chill as of doom swiftly
had replaced the balm of the southern sky;
and forsooth, all the mercy of the world seemed
lost and gone.</p>

<p>And as our craft, laboring, thrust forward
blindly into this reek, with naught of comfort
on any hand, nor even the dimmest ray of
hope visible from any fixed thing on ahead, in
like travail of going, in like groaning to the
very soul, the bark of my life now lay in the
welter, helpless, reft of storm and strife, blind,
counseled by no fixed ray ahead. I know not
what purpose remained in me, that, like the
ship which bore us, I still, dumbly and without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
conscious purpose, forged onward to some
point fixed by reason or desire before reason
and desire had been engulfed by this final unkindness
of the world. For myself, I cared
little or none at all. The plunge of the boat,
the shriek of the wind, the wild magic and
mystery of it, would have comported not ill
with a strong man&rsquo;s tastes even in hours more
happy, and now, especially, they jumped with
the wild protest of a soul eager for some outlet
of action or excitement. But for these others,
these women&mdash;this woman&mdash;these boys, all
brought into this danger by my own mad folly,
ah! when the thought of these arose, a swift
remorse caught me; and though for myself I
feared not at all, for these I feared.</p>

<p>Needs must, therefore, use every cool skilled
resource that lay at hand. No time now for
broken hearts to ask attention, the ship must
be sailed. Crippled or not, what she had of
help for us must be got out of her, used, fostered,
nourished. All the art of the navigator
must be charged with this duty. We must
win through. And, as many a man who has
seen danger will testify, the great need brought
to us all a great calm and a steady precision in
that which needed doing.</p>

<p>I saw Peterson at the wheel, wet to the skin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>
as now and again a seventh wave, slow, portentous,
deadly-deliberate, showed ahead of us,
advanced, reared and pounded down on us
with its tons of might. But he only shook the
brine from his eyes and held her up, waiting
for the slow pulse of our crippled engine to
come on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t keep my pipe lit!&rdquo; he called to me,
as I stood beside him; and at last, Peterson, in
a real time of danger, seemed altogether happy
and altogether free of apprehension beyond
that regarding his pipe.</p>

<p>At the first breaking of the storm I had, of
course, ordered all ports closed, and had sent
both my young companions to the ladies&rsquo; cabin
aft, as the driest part of the boat. Even there,
the water that sometimes fell upon our decks
as the great waves broke, poured aft and even
broke about the cabin, drenching everything
above deck. It was man&rsquo;s work that was to
be done now, yet none could bear a hand in it
save the engineer and the steersman. I was,
therefore, ready sternly to reprove Jean Lafitte
when, presently, I saw him making the
perilous passage forward, clinging to the rail
and wet to the skin before he could reach the
forward deck. But he protested so earnestly
and seemed withal so fit and keen, that I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
relented and allowed him to take his place by us
at the wheel, showing him as well as I could,
on the chart, the course we were trying to hold&mdash;the
mouth of a long channel, six miles or
more, dredged by the government across a foot
of the bay and making through to deeper
and more sheltered waters beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t hit her, in this fog!&rdquo; asked
Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our business to do that,&rdquo; was my reply.
&ldquo;In an hour or so more we shall know. How
did you leave the ladies, Jean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, he&rsquo;s sicker&rsquo;n anything,&rdquo; was his reply,
&ldquo;except the old lady, and she&rsquo;s sicker&rsquo;n
Jimmy! The young lady, Miss Emory, she&rsquo;s
all right, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; their heads. She
says she don&rsquo;t get sick. Neither do I&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
that funny? But gee, this is rougher&rsquo;n any
waves ever was on our lake. What&rsquo;re you
goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold straight ahead, Jean,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;Now, wouldn&rsquo;t you better go back to the
others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, I ain&rsquo;t scared&mdash;much. I told Jimmy,
I did, any pirate ought to be ashamed to get
sick. But they&rsquo;re all scared. So&rsquo;m I, some,&rdquo;
he added frankly.</p>

<p>I might have made some confession of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
own, had I liked, for I did not, in the least,
fancy the look of things; but after a time, I
compromised with sturdy Jean by sending him
below into the dining saloon, whence he could
look out through the glass front and see the
tumbling sea ahead. Through the glazed housing
I could see him standing, hands in pockets,
legs wide, gazing out in the simple confidence
that all was well, and enjoying the tumult and
excitement of it all in his boyish ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; grinned Peterson to me,
and I only nodded in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we, Peterson?&rdquo; I asked, putting a
finger on the wet chart before us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;It
depends on the drift, which we can&rsquo;t calculate.
Soundings mean nothing, for she&rsquo;s shallow for
miles. If the fog would break, so we could
see the light&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t any fog-buoy on that
channel mouth, and it&rsquo;s murder that there ain&rsquo;t.
It&rsquo;s this d&mdash;&mdash;d fog that makes it bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It was now going on
five o&rsquo;clock, and in this light, it soon would be
night for us. Peterson caught the time, and
frowned. &ldquo;Wish&rsquo;t we was in,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;No
use trying to anchor unless we must, anyhow&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
ride mighty wet out here. Better buck
on into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
So we bucked on in, till five, till five-thirty,
till six, and all the boat&rsquo;s lights revealed was
a yellow circle of fog that traveled with us.
Wet and chilled, we two stood at the wheel
together, in such hard conditions that no navigator
and no pilot could have done much more
than grope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have missed her!&rdquo; admitted the
old skipper at last. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy the open
gulf, and I don&rsquo;t fancy piling her up on some
shore in here. What do you think we should
do, Mr. Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said I, raising a hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bell-buoy,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but hark. Don&rsquo;t you hear the birds&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a million geese and swans and ducks
calling over yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, by George!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d not be at sea, Peterson. They must
be in some fresh-water lake inside some key or
island. On the Long Key there&rsquo;s such an
inland lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond the channel, maybe?&rdquo; said he.
But he signaled Williams to go slow, and that
faithful unseen Cyclops, on whose precious engines
so much depended, obeyed and presently
put out a head at his hatch, quickly withdrawing
it as a white sea came inboard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll crawl on in,&rdquo; said Peterson. &ldquo;The
light can&rsquo;t be a thousand miles from here. If
only there was a nigger man and a dinner bell
beside the light&mdash;that&rsquo;s the trouble. And now&mdash;good
God! <em>There she goes!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a jar which shook the good boat to the
core, we felt the bottom come up from the
depths and smite us. Our headway ceased,
save for a sickening crunching crawl. The
waves piled clear across our port bow as we
swung. And so we hung, the gulf piling in
on us in our yellow rimmed world. And at
the lift and hollow of the sea we rose and
pounded sullenly down, in such fashion as
would have broken the back of any boat less
stanch than ours.</p>

<p>Here, in an eye&rsquo;s flash, was danger tangible
and real. I heard a shriek from the cabin aft,
and called out for them all to keep below and
keep the ports closed. Peterson had the power
off in an instant, and swung her head as best
he could with the dying headway; but it only
put her farther on the shoal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Timbalier Shoals!&rdquo; he screamed.
&ldquo;Oh, d&mdash;&mdash; it all! We&rsquo;ll lose her, now.&rdquo; I
recalled that his concern seemed rather for his
boat than the lives she carried.</p>

<p>Jean Lafitte came bounding up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>
companionway, his face pale, but ready for ship&rsquo;s discipline.
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I quickly, &ldquo;help me
with the anchor.&rdquo; A moment later, we sprung
the capstan clutch, and I heard the brief growl
of the anchor chain as the big hook ran free.
Glad enough I was to think of the extra size
it had. We eased her down and made fast
under Peterson&rsquo;s orders now, and so swung
into the head of the sea, which mercilessly
lifted us and flung us down like a monkey seeking
to crack a cocoanut shell. Williams joined
us now, and Willie and John, pale as Jean Lafitte,
came up from the forecastle, all shouting
and jabbering. I ran aft as soon as might be,
and only pulled up at the cabin door to summon
such air of calm as I might. I rapped,
but followed in, not waiting. Helena met me,
pale, her eyes wide, her hair disheveled, but
none the less mistress of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;What makes
it jolt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone aground,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;She does
pound a little, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked out into the wild night, across
which the voices of the confused wild fowl came
like souls in torment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo; said she simply. &ldquo;Are we
lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Let us hear no such talk. Go
below, now, and keep quiet. We may pass the
night here, or we may conclude after a little
to go on ahead a little farther. We&rsquo;ve just
dropped the anchor. The island&rsquo;s just over
there a way.&rdquo; I did not care to be too specific.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, oh, what is it?&rdquo; I heard the
faint voice of Mrs. Daniver. &ldquo;Oh, this is awful.
I&mdash;am&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;die, going to <em>die</em>!&rdquo; The agony
of <i>mal de mer</i> was hers now of full license, for
the choppy sea was sustained on the bosom of
a long ground swell, coming we knew not
whence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; I called down. &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; answered L&rsquo;Olonnois bravely, from
his place on the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling pretty funny,
but I&rsquo;ll be all right&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay right where you are&mdash;and you also,
Miss Emory. I must go forward now, and just
came to tell you it&rsquo;s all right. If there should
be any need, we&rsquo;ll let you know. Now keep
down, and keep the door shut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;going&mdash;to&mdash;<em>die</em>!&rdquo; moaned Mrs. Daniver
as I left. Helena made no outcry, but that
horror possessed her I knew very well, for
every reason told us that our case was desperate.
The boat might start her seams or
break her back, any instant, now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
I found the men trying to make soundings
all about us as best they could with boat hooks
and a spare spar. But it came to little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re ship&rsquo;s master.
What are your orders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unlash the boat covers,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Get
even the dingey ready. Williams, close your
hatch and bear a hand to swing the big boat
out in her davits. Set the bottom plugs in
well. And Mr. Harry, you and John, the Chink,
had better get some stores and a case or so of
bottled water aboard the long boat. Have you
got the slickers and rugs ready, and plenty of
clothes? We&rsquo;ll just be ready if it happens. I
don&rsquo;t know where that damned light or the
damned channel is, but the damned ducks maybe
know where some damned thing is. We&rsquo;ll
run for them, if we can&rsquo;t ride her out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all hurried now, Jean Lafitte at my heels,
silent and faithful as a dog, aiding me as I
piled blankets and coats and rugs from our
cabin into the ship&rsquo;s boat, which swayed and
swung perilously at the davits. What with the
aid of John, the China boy, and Willy, the deck-hand,
we also got supplies aboard her, I scarce
knew what, except that there seemed abundance.
And then we stood waiting for what
might happen, helpless in the hands of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
offended elements, and silent all. I held Jean&rsquo;s
hand in my own. He was loyal to his mate,
even now. &ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;d be here,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Course he would, only he&rsquo;s so awful sick. I
ain&rsquo;t sick&mdash;yet, but I feel funny, someway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peterson stood looking ahead, but was anxious.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming up stronger,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and two points on the port quarter. We&rsquo;re
going on harder all the time. Anchor&rsquo;s dragging.
Afraid we&rsquo;re going to lose her, Mr.
Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said I, nodding to the boy. &ldquo;And
turn on the search-light. It seems to me I hear
breakers in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Hook on
the light&rsquo;s battery, Williams, and let&rsquo;s see what
we can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strong beam, wavering from side to side,
plowed a furry path into the fog. It disclosed
at first only the succession of angry incoming
waves, each, as it passed, thudding us down
on the bar of shell and mud and slime. But
at last, off to starboard and well astern in our
new position, riding at anchor, we raised a
faint white line of broken water which seemed
a constant feature; and now and then caught
the low boom of the surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t a half mile, over yonder,&rdquo; I heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
Willy, the deck-hand, say. &ldquo;An&rsquo; we could almost
walk it if it wasn&rsquo;t for the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Williams, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d do fine in
there now, with them boats. When we hit
that white water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; ordered Peterson. &ldquo;Safe as a
church, here or there, you lubbers. Stand by
your tackle, and keep your chin. Mr. Harry,
tell the ladies just to wrap up a bit, because&mdash;well,
maybe, because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me when it is time, Peterson,&rdquo; said I;
and moved aft, holding Jean Lafitte by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said he, as he dropped, wet and out
of breath, into the cabin; and &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; remarked
a very pale L&rsquo;Olonnois in return, gamely as he
could. And Mrs. Daniver&rsquo;s moans went rhythmic
with the pound of the keel on the shoal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Helena at last
calmly. &ldquo;Auntie is very sick. I am beginning
to fear for her, it is such a bad attack. This
is as rough as I ever saw it on the Channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no danger,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but Peterson
and I just thought that if she kept on pounding
in this way, it might be better to go
ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spoke lightly, but well enough I knew the
risk of trying to launch a boat in such a sea;
and what the surf might be, none could say.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
Ah, how I wished that my empty assurance
might be the truth. For I knew that, anyway
we looked, only danger stared back at us now,
on every hand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE TAKE TO THE BOATS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> LOOKED at the woman I loved, and self-reproach
was in my soul, as I saw a shudder
go across her form. She was pale, but
beyond a swift look at me made no sign connecting
me, either with the wreck or the rescue.
I think she had even then abandoned all
hope of safety; and in my own heart, such,
also, was the rising conviction which I concealed.
Under the inborn habit of self-preservation,
under the cultivated habit of the well
born, to show no fear and to use the resources
of a calm mind to the last in time of danger,
we stood now, at least, in some human equality.
And again I lied and said, &ldquo;There is no danger,&rdquo;
though I could see the white rollers and could
hear their roar on the shore.</p>

<p>The night grew wilder. The great gulf
storm had not yet reached its climax, and none
could tell what pitch of fury that might mean.
The dull jar of the boat as she time and again
was flung down by the waves, the shiver and
creak and groan of the sturdy craft, told us
that the end might come at any instant, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
now the anchor held firm and our crawl on to
the shoal had ceased. All around us was water
only four or five feet deep, but water whose
waves were twice as high. Once the final
crash came, and it would be too late to launch
a boat, and all of us, overboard in that welter,
were gone.</p>

<p>Silently, I stepped on deck once more, and
motioned to Willy, the deck-hand, to bring me
the life preservers. &ldquo;Put them on,&rdquo; I said to
Helena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; moaned the older
woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying&mdash;let me alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop this nonsense, madam,&rdquo; said I sternly&mdash;knowing
that was the only way&mdash;&ldquo;put it on
at once. You too, Miss Emory, and you, my
boys. Quick. Then throw on loose wraps&mdash;all
you can. It will be cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of all my efforts to seem calm, the
air of panic ran swiftly. Mrs. Daniver awoke
to swift action as she tremblingly fastened the
belt about her. Pushing past me, she reached
the deck, and so mad was she that in all
likelihood she would have sprung overboard.
I caught at her, and though my clutch brought
away little more than a handful of false hair,
it seemed to restore her reason though it destroyed
her coiffure. &ldquo;Enough of this!&rdquo; I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
cried to her. &ldquo;Take your place by the boat,
and do as you are told.&rdquo; And I saw Helena
pass forward, also, as we all reached the deck,
herself pale as a wraith, but with no outcry and
no spoken word. So, at last, I ranged them all
near the boat that swung ready at the davits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all get in that,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I: and I did not like to look at
the tiny dingey which lay on the cabin-top,
squat and tub-like, or the small ducking skiff
that here on deck was half full of water from
the breaking seas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;take charge of the big
boat here. Take Williams to run her motor
for you. And the ladies will go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned to the two boys, and my heart
leaped in pride for them both; for when I motioned
to Jimmy to make ready for the large
boat, with the ladies, he stepped back, pale as
he was. &ldquo;Not unless John goes, too,&rdquo; said he.
And they stood side by side, simply and with
no outcry, their young faces grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must go with us&mdash;Jimmy,&rdquo; broke out
Helena yearningly: &ldquo;and so must you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Auntie,&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy most
irreverently. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a-runnin&rsquo; this boat, like
to know?&rdquo; Which abashed his auntie very
much.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take this one,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte, and
already was tipping the duck boat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll carry
us three if it has to.&rdquo; And I allowed him and
his mate to stand by, not daring to look at its
inadequate shell and again at the breaking
seas.</p>

<p>That left the dingey for Willy and the cook.
I glanced at Willy. &ldquo;Which would you rather
chance?&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;the dingey or the duck
boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dingey,&rdquo; said he quickly,&mdash;and we both
knew the cork-like quality of this stubby craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Call John, when the
word comes to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going with us?&rdquo; asked Helena
now, suddenly, approaching me. I took one
long look into her eyes, then, &ldquo;Obey orders,&rdquo;
was all I said, and pointed to the larger boat.
I said good-by to her then. And, in the swift
intuitive justice that comes to us in moments
of extremity, I passed sentence upon these
young boys and myself. Though they had sinned
in innocence, though I had sinned in love,
it had been our folly that had brought these
others into this peril, and our chance must be
the least. Peterson and Williams would be a
better team in the big boat than any other we
could afford. I saw Peterson step toward us,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
and divined what was in his mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m owner
of this boat, my man,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Go to your
duty. You&rsquo;re needed in the big boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m last to leave her,&rdquo; whispered the old
man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my boat, and I&rsquo;ve run her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, taking him aside, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
buy us another boat. But there is no woman
on earth, nor ever will be, like that one yonder.
Save her. It is your first duty. I wanted
that for myself, but she thinks I&rsquo;m a coward,
and I would be, if I arranged our crews any
other way than just as we are. Take your
boat through. We others will do the best we
can. And give the word for the boats when
you&rsquo;re sure we can&rsquo;t ride it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silently, the old man touched his cap, and
giving me one look, he went to the bows of
his boat. The <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, lashed by the
storm, rolled and pulled at her cable, rose, fell
thuddingly. And at last, came a giant swell
that almost submerged us. I caught Helena to
the cabin-top to keep her drier from it, and the
two boys also sprang to a point of safety. Mrs.
Daniver, less agile, was caught by Peterson
and Williams and held to the rail, wetted thoroughly.
And by some freak of the wind, at
that instant came fully the roar of the surf.
We of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> seemed very small.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
I looked now at Peterson. He raised his
little megaphone, which hung at his belt, and
shouted loud and clear, as though we could
not have heard him at this distance of ten
feet. &ldquo;Get ready to lower away!&rdquo; Williams
and the deck-hand sprang to the falls. &ldquo;Get
the women in the boat, you, Williams,&rdquo; called
the skipper, &ldquo;and go in with them to steady
her when she floats. Take his place there, Mr.
Harry. Lively now!&rdquo; And how we got the
two women into the swinging boat I hardly
knew.</p>

<p>The old skipper cast one eye ahead as a big
wave rolled astern. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;Lower away, there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boat dropped into the cup of a sea, rose
level with the rail the next instant, and tossed
perilously. I saw the two women huddled in
the bottom of her, their eyes covered, saw Williams
climbing over them and easing her at the
bowline. Then, as we seized the next instant
of the rhythm, and hauled her alongside, Peterson
made a leap and went aboard her, and
Williams scrambled back, once more, across
the two huddled forms. I saw him wrench at
the engine crank, and heard the spitting chug
of the little motor. They fell off in the seaway,
Peterson holding her with an oar as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
could till the screws caught. Then I saw her answer
the helm and they staggered off, passing
out of the beam of our search-light, so that it
seemed to me I had said good-by to Helena
forever.</p>

<p>We who remained had no davits to aid us,
and must launch by hand. For a moment I
stood and made my plans. First, I called to
Willy, our deck-hand, who had the dingey
now astern, some fashion. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;
I demanded: but the next moment I heard his
call astern and knew that, monkey-like, he had
got her over and was aboard her somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;come here and shake
hands with Black Bart.&rdquo; They came, their
serious eyes turned up to me. And never has
deeper emotion seized me than as I felt their
young hands in mine. We said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, bear a hand there, you, Jean!&rdquo; I
pulled open the gate of the rail, and ran out
the landing stage, on which the flat-bottomed
skiff sat. With an oar I pushed it across at
right angles as nearly as possible when she
cleared. &ldquo;Quick! Get in, both of you,&rdquo; I
called. I was holding the inboard end of the
plank under a wedged oar shaft, thrust below
the sill of the forward cabin door. They scrambled
out and in, Jean grasping the bight of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span>
painter that I handed him, and passing it over
the rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look out,&rdquo; I called, and dropped the
landing stage to meet the swell of the next
wave. They slid, tilted, righted, rose high&mdash;and
held. The next moment I sprang, fell into
the sea, was caught by the collar as my hand
grasped the cockpit coaming, and so I slid in,
somehow, over the end deck, and caught the
end of the painter from John&rsquo;s hand and cast
her free.</p>

<p>The drift carried us off at once, and the next
wave almost hid the hull of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>.
I knew at once we were powerless, and that
our one hope lay in drifting ashore. There is
no worse sea boat than a low, flat ducking
boat, decked though she be, and of good coaming,
for she butts into and does not rise to a
sea. But now, I thanked my star, one thing
only was in our favor. We rolled like a log,
already half full of water, but we floated, because
in each end of our skiff was a big empty
tin air tank, put there in spite of the laughing
protest of the builder, who said no room was
left for decoys under the decks. Just now,
those tin cans were worth more than many
duck decoys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep down!&rdquo; I ordered. &ldquo;And hold on!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>
The boys obeyed me. I could see their gaze
bent on me, as the source of their hope, their
reliance. Jimmy was now free from the first
violence of the seasickness, but I saw Jean&rsquo;s hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; I heard the latter mutter as the first
sea crossed under us. &ldquo;Dat was a peach.&rdquo; I
took heart myself, for we lived that one
through. &ldquo;Bail!&rdquo; I ordered, and they took
their cups to it, while I did all I could with
the long punt paddle to make some sort of
course. Now and then the blazing trail of the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne&rsquo;s</i> search-light swung across as we
rolled, to leave us, the next instant, in blackness.
As the seas permitted, we could see her,
riding and rocking, sometimes, alight from
stern to stern and making a gallant fight for
her life, as were we all.</p>

<p>So long as the rollers came in oily and black,
we did well, but where the top of one broke
under us, we sank deep into the white foam
that had no carrying power, and our cockpit
filled so that we all sat in water. Only the
tanks held us, log-like, and we bailed and paddled:
and after they saw we did not sink, my
hardy bullies, perhaps in the ignorance of youth
and boy&rsquo;s confidence that a boy and water are
friends, began to shout aloud. We wallowed on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
No sound came to us from either of the other
boats; and now, very quickly it seemed, we
came at the edge of the surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m touching bottom, boys,&rdquo; I called, and
cast the long punt pole adrift as I took up the
short paddle I had held under my leg.</p>

<p>Now we had under us two feet of water or
ten, as the waves might say, and any moment
we might roll over; but we wallowed in, rolling,
till I knew the supreme moment had come.
I waited, holding her head in well as I could
so unruly a hulk, and as a big roller came after
us, paddled as hard as I could. The wave
chased us, caught us, pushed us, carried us in.
There was a lift of our loggish bows, a blinding
crash of white water about us. Our boat was
overturned, but in some way, since the beach
was all sand and very gentle, the wave flattened
so that the back-tow did not pull us
down. In some way, I do not know how, I
found myself standing, and dragging Jimmy by
the hand. Jean already was ahead, and I
heard his shout and saw his hand as he stood,
knee-deep but safe. So we all made it ashore,
and our boat also, which now we hauled out of
the spume. And the long white row of breakers,
less dangerous than I had feared, came in,
white maned and bellowing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
I could still see the rocking lights of the
yacht, and the shifting stroke of the search-light
on the sea, but I did not hear and see
aught else, at the time, and my heart sank.</p>

<p>It was Jimmy whose ear first got the sound
which came in&mdash;the feverish phut-phut of the
motor skiff. Then the ray of the great light
swung and I saw the boat still outside the
breakers&mdash;nor could I tell then why we had
beaten her in. It seemed Peterson was hunting
for us others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay back, boys!&rdquo; I called to my companions.
&ldquo;You might get thrown down by the
waves&mdash;keep back.&rdquo; But now I was ready to
rush in to meet the long boat, whose keel I
knew would leave her to overturn if she caught
bottom.</p>

<p>But Peterson knew about the keel as well
as any, and he caught what he thought was
water enough before he yelled to Williams to
drive her in. She sped in like an arrow; and
again the white wave reared high and broke
upon its prey. By then, I was in water to my
waist. I caught Helena out with one reach of
my arms, just as I saw Williams and Peterson
stagger in with Mrs. Daniver between them.
In some miraculous way we got beyond danger,
and met my pirates, dancing and shouting
a welcome to our desert isle. Their advent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
thereon, gave the two womenfolk a fervent
wish to embrace, sob and weep extraordinarily.
I had said nothing to Helena and said nothing
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the dingey, Peterson?&rdquo; I called,
as he came up, grinning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming in,&rdquo; said he; and forsooth that
water-rat, Willy, made a better landing of it
than any of us, and calmly helped us now to
haul the heavy motor skiff up the beach, a
few feet at a time as the waves thrust it forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; I heard Helena exclaim. &ldquo;Oh,
thank God! We&rsquo;re safe, we&rsquo;re all safe, after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at my little group for a time, all
soaked to the skin, all huddled now close together.
Peterson, Williams, Willy&mdash;all the
crew, yes. Auntie Lucinda and the woman
who had called me a coward&mdash;the two captives,
yes, Jean Lafitte and Henri L&rsquo;Olonnois and myself,
Black Bart&mdash;all the ship&rsquo;s owners. What
lacked? For a moment I could not tell why
I had the vague feeling that something or
some one was missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willy,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s John, the
cook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Willy. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
he come with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I RESCUE THE COOK</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;W</span>HAT&rsquo;S that?&rdquo; said Peterson sharply&mdash;&ldquo;you
didn&rsquo;t obey orders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought he was in the other boat,&rdquo;
explained Willy, hanging his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get your time,&rdquo; said the old man
quietly, &ldquo;soon as we get to the railroad&mdash;and
you&rsquo;ll go home by rail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do, Mr. Harry?&rdquo;
he demanded of me, a moment later. I was
looking at the long boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s part of the boat&rsquo;s company,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got to save him, Peterson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Helena now coming
up&mdash;and then, &ldquo;Why, John, our cook, isn&rsquo;t
here, is he?&rdquo; She, too, looked at the long boat
and at the sea. &ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean to do?&rdquo; she demanded
now of Peterson in turn. The old man only
looked at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, you don&rsquo;t mean to go out there
again,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>I turned to them both, half cold with anger.
&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d leave him out there to die,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg&nbsp;325]</a></span>
perhaps? It was my own fault, not to see him
in the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; reiterated Peterson. &ldquo;It was
Willy&rsquo;s fault&mdash;or mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In either case it&rsquo;s likely to be equally serious
for him. We can&rsquo;t leave the poor devil
helpless, that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harry,&rdquo; began Peterson again, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
only a Chinaman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take shame to yourself for that, Peterson,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a part of the boat&rsquo;s company&mdash;a
good cook&mdash;yes, but more than a good
cook&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t he come up with the rest
of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he was at his place of duty, below,
until ordered up,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>Peterson pondered for a moment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right,&rdquo; said he at length; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt Helena&rsquo;s hand on my arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful
out there,&rdquo; said she. But I only turned to look
at her in the half-darkness and shook off her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t launch the big boat,&rdquo; said Peterson.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d only swamp her, if you tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but the real thing is
to try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might wait till the wind lulls,&rdquo; he argued.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, and if the wind should change she
might drag her anchor and go out to sea.
Which boat is best to take, Peterson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strange feeling of calm came over me, an
odd feeling not easy to explain, that I was not
a young man of leisure, but some one else, one
of my ancestors of earlier days, used to encounters
with adversity or risk. Calmly and
much to my own surprise, I stood and estimated
the chances as though I had been used
to such things all my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is the best boat, Peterson?&rdquo; I repeated.
&ldquo;Hardly the duck boat, I think&mdash;and
you say not the big boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dingey is the safest,&rdquo; replied Peterson.
&ldquo;That little tub would ride better; but no man
could handle her out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll get her second
wetting, anyhow. Lend a hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll carry us both,&rdquo; commented the old
man, stepping to the side of the stubby little
craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll be lighter and ride easier with
but one,&rdquo; was my reply. &ldquo;A chip is dry on top
only as long as it&rsquo;s a chip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go along,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte, stepping
up at this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort, my son,&rdquo; said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
I. &ldquo;Go back to the ladies and make a fire, and
make a shelter,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here again
before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news of the new adventure now spread
among our little party. Mrs. Daniver began
sniffling. &ldquo;Helena,&rdquo; I heard her say, &ldquo;this is
terrible.&rdquo; But meantime I was pulling off my
sweater and fastening on a life belt. Nodding
to Peterson, we both picked up the dingey, and
when the next sea favored, made a swift run in
the endeavor to break through the surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; I cried to him, as the water
swirled about our waist. &ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; And so
I sprang in alone and left him.</p>

<p>For the time I could make small headway,
indeed, had not time to get at the oars, but
pushing as I might with the first thing that
came to hand, I felt the bottom under me, felt
again the lift of the sea carry me out of touch.
Then an incoming wave carried me back almost
to the point whence I had started. In such
way as I could not explain, none the less at
length the little boat won through, no more
than half filled by the breaking comber. I
worked first as best I might, paddling, and so
keeping her off the best I could. Then when
I got the oars, the stubby yawing little tub
at first seemed scarce more than to hold her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
own. I pulled hard&mdash;hard as I could. Slowly,
the line of white breakers passed astern. After
that, saving my strength a trifle, I edged out,
now angling into the wind, now pulling full
into the teeth of the gale. Even my purpose
was almost forgotten in the intensity of the
task of merely keeping away from the surf.
Dully I pulled, reasoning no more than that
that was the thing for me to do.</p>

<p>It had seemed a mile, that short half-mile
between the yacht and the beach. It seemed
a hundred miles now going back to the boat.
I did not dare ask myself how I could go
aboard if even I won across so far as the yacht.
It was enough that I did not slip backward to
the beach once more. Yawing and jibbing in
the wind which caught her stubby freeboard,
the little boat, none the less, held up under me,
and once she was bailed of the surf, rode fairly
dry in spite of all, being far more buoyant
than either of the other craft. Once in the
dark, I saw something thrust up beside me and
fancied it to be a stake, marking the channel
which pierced the key hereabout. This was
confirmed in my mind when, presently, as rain
began to fall and the fog lessened for the time,
I saw the blurred yellow lighthouse eye answering
the wavering search-light of the <i>Belle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
Hel&egrave;ne</i>, which swept from side to side across
the bay as she rolled heavily at her anchor.
In spite of the hard fight it had given me, I
was glad the wind still held inshore. I knew
the point of the little island lay not far beyond
the light. Once adrift beyond that, not the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> herself would be safe, in this offshore
wind, but must be carried out into the
gulf beyond.</p>

<p>Not reasoning much about this, however,
and content with mere pulling, I kept on until
at length I saw the nodding lights of the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i> lighting the gloom more definitely
about me. Presently, I made under her lee, so
that the dingey was more manageable, and at
last, I edged up almost to her rail, planning
how, perhaps, I might cast a line and so make
fast. But, first, I tried calling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there below, John!&rdquo; I called through
the dark. At first there came no answer, and
again I shouted. At this I saw the door of the
dining saloon pushed open, and John himself
thrust out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All litee,&rdquo; said he, merely greeting me casually.
&ldquo;You come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, with equal sang-froid. &ldquo;You
makee quick jump now, John, s&rsquo;pose I come
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg&nbsp;330]</a></span>
&ldquo;All litee,&rdquo; said he once more. I saw now
that he stood there, a book and a bundle in his
arm. Perhaps he had been reading to pass
the time!</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I cautiously pulled the
dingey under the lee of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>.
Timing his leap with a sagacity and agility
combined which I had not suspected of him,
my China boy made a leap, stumbled, righted
himself, got his balance and so placed his
bundle on the bottom of the boat and his book
upon the seat, where he covered it carefully
against the spray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All litee,&rdquo; said he once more. &ldquo;I makee
pull now. You come this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I endeavored to emulate his Oriental calm.
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I catchee plenty wind this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, plenty wind,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You suppose we leave China boy?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; he exclaimed with emphasis.
&ldquo;I know you come back allee time bimeby,
one time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I leed plenty &rsquo;Melican book,&rdquo; said he calmly.
&ldquo;Now I makee pull.&rdquo; To oblige him I
made way for him, and we crawled past each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
other on the floor of the heaving dingey. He
took the oars and began pulling with an odd
chopping sort of a stroke, perhaps learned in
his youth on some sampan that rode the waters
of his native land; but for my own part, since
Fate seemed to be kind to me after all, I
trusted his skill, such as it was, and was willing
to rest for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No velly bad,&rdquo; said John judicially, after a
time. &ldquo;Pretty soon come in.&rdquo; No doubt he
saw the little fire, now beginning to light the
beach. At any rate, he headed straight in,
the seas following, reeling after us. They
have their own ways, these people of the East.
I fancy John had run surf before. At any rate,
I knew the water now was shallow and that,
perhaps, one could swim ashore if we were
overset. I trusted him to make the landing,
however, and he did it like a veteran. One
plunge through the ultimate white crest, and
we were carried up high on the beach, to meet
the shouts of my men and to feel their hands
grasp the gunwales of the sturdy little craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All litee,&rdquo; remarked John amiably, and
started for the fire, such being his instinct, not
with the purpose of getting warm, but of cooking
something. And in half an hour he had a
cup of hot bouillon all around.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a commendable thing,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Daniver, &ldquo;that you, sir, should go to the rescue
of even a humble Chinaman. I find this bouillon
delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you quite recovered from your seasickness
by this time, Mrs. Daniver?&rdquo; I asked
politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seasickness?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow in
protest. &ldquo;I never was seasick in my life&mdash;not
even in the roughest crossings of the Channel,
where others were quite helpless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fortunate to be immune,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;People
tell me it is a terrible feeling&mdash;they even
think they are going to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Lafitte, I found, had made quite a serviceable
shelter, throwing a tarpaulin over one
of the long boat&rsquo;s oars. We pushed our fire
to the front of this, and after a time induced
the ladies to make themselves more comfortable.
Only with some protest did my hearty
pirates agree to share this shelter which made
our sole protection against the storm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE ARE CASTAWAYS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE rain came down dismally, and the chill
of the night was very considerable, as I
learned soon after ceasing my own exertions.
The men made some sort of shelter for themselves
by turning up the long boat and the
dingey on edge, crawling into the lee, and
thus finding a little protection. All but John,
my cook. That calm personage, every time I
turned, was at my elbow in the dark, standing
silent, waiting for I knew not what. For the
first time, I realized the virtue of his waterproof
silk shirt. He seemed not to mind the
rain, although he asked my consent to put his
bundle and his book under the shelter. I
stooped down at the firelight, curious to see
the title of his book. It was familiar&mdash;<i>The
Pirate&rsquo;s Own Book</i>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you catchee book, John?&rdquo; I asked
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Litlee boy he give me; him &rsquo;Melican book.
I lead him some. Plenty good book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I see. That boy&rsquo;ll make
pirates of us all, if we aren&rsquo;t careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg&nbsp;334]</a></span>
&ldquo;That book, him tellee what do, sposee bad
storm,&rdquo; said John proudly. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked over to where Peterson lay, his
pipe now lighted by some magic all his own.
We now could see more plainly the furred and
yellow gleam of the lighthouse lamp. Peterson&rsquo;s
concern, however, was all for the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to think of her out there all by herself,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I, Peterson. I hate also to think of all
that ninety-three we left out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were standing near the edge of the ladies&rsquo;
shelter, and I heard Mrs. Daniver&rsquo;s voice as she
put out her head at the edge of the tarpaulin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said all the ninety-three was
gone,&rdquo; said she with some interest, as it appeared
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we only had the last bottle of that case
at luncheon, Mrs. Daniver,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;There
are yet other cases out yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad night for neuralgia,&rdquo; said she
complainingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, madam. But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll pull
out again. And I am rejoiced that you are not
troubled now with seasickness,&mdash;that you never
are.&rdquo; Which last resulted in her dignified
silence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span>
Through the night, there came continually
the clamoring of the wild fowl in the lagoon
back of us, and this seemed to make the boys
restless. It was Jean Lafitte, next, who poked
his head out from under the tarpaulin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the gun all right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and a
lot of shells. In the morning we&rsquo;ll go out and
get some of those ducks that are squawking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jean,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in one of the best
ducking countries on this whole coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine&mdash;we can live chiefly by huntin&rsquo;
and fishin&rsquo;, like it says in the g&rsquo;ographies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the wind should shift,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we may
have to do that for quite a time. I don&rsquo;t know
whether the lighthouse keeper has a boat or
not, and the channel lies between us and the
light&mdash;it makes out here straight to the Gulf.
But now, be quiet, my sons, and see if we
can&rsquo;t all get some sleep. I&rsquo;ll take care of the
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I passed a little apart to hunt for some driftwood,
my shadow, John, following close at
hand. When I returned I found a muffled
figure standing at the feeble blaze. Helena
raised her eyes, grave and serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was splendid,&rdquo; said she in a low tone of
voice, addressing not so much myself as all the
world, it seemed to me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span>
&ldquo;Get back in there and go to sleep,&rdquo; said I.
And, quietly she obeyed, so far as I might tell.</p>

<p>For my own part, I did not seek the shelter
of the other boat, but, wrapped in sweater and
slicker, stood in the rain, John at my side.
Once in a while we set out in the dark to find
more wood for the little fire. In some way
the long night wore on. Toward morning the
rain ceased. It seemed to me that the rocking
search-light of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> made scarce
so wide an arc across the bay. The lighthouse
ray shone less furry and yellow through the
night. The wind began to lull, coming in gusts,
at times after some moments of calm. The
roll of the sea still came in, but sometimes I
almost fancied that the surf was bellowing not
so loud. And so at length, the dawn came,
softening the gloom, and I could hear the roar
of the great bodies of wild fowl rising as they
always do at dawn, the tumult of their wings
rivaling the heavy rhythm of the surf itself.</p>

<p>The advancing calm of nature seemed to
quiet the senses of the sleepers, even in their
sleep. Gently making up the fire for the last
time, as the gray light began to come across
the beach, I wandered inland a little way in
search of the fresh water lagoon. Its edge
lay not more than two or three hundred yards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg&nbsp;337]</a></span>
back of our bivouac. So, as best I might, I
bathed my face and hands, and regretted that
such things as soap and towels had been forgotten
with many other things. Not irremediable,
our plight; for now I could see the <i>Belle
Hel&egrave;ne</i> still rolling at her anchor, uneasy, but
still afloat; and in the daylight, and with a lessening
sea, there would be no great difficulty
in boarding her as we liked.</p>

<p>Presently the others of the party were all
afoot, standing stiffly, sluggishly, in the chill of
dawn; and such was the breakfast which my
boy John presently prepared for us, that I confess
I began to make comparisons not wholly
to his discredit. Now, for instance, said I to
myself, had it been Mrs. Daniver who had
been forgotten on board ship&mdash;but, of course,
that line of reasoning might not be followed
out. And as for Mrs. Daniver herself, it was
only just to say that she made a fair attempt
at comradeship, considering that she had retired
without any aid whatever for her neuralgia.
Helena seemed reticent. The men, as
usual, ate apart. I did not find myself loquacious.
Only my two young ruffians seemed full
of the enjoyment possible in such a situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! ain&rsquo;t this fine?&rdquo; said L&rsquo;Olonnois. &ldquo;I
never did think we&rsquo;d be really shipwrecked and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg&nbsp;338]</a></span>
cast away on a desert island. This is just like
it is in the books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we go huntin&rsquo; now?&rdquo; demanded Jean
Lafitte, his mouth still full of bacon. &ldquo;And
will you come along? There must be millions
of them ducks and geese. I didn&rsquo;t know there
was so many in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go, both of you, Jean Lafitte,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll be careful not to shoot yourselves.
As for me, I must go back once more
to the boat, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peterson and I now held a brief conference,
and presently, leaving the ladies in charge of
Willy and the cook, we two, with Williams to
run the motor, with some difficulty launched
the long boat and made off through a sea none
too amiable, to go aboard the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>
once more&mdash;which so short a time before I had
thought we never might do again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is easier than pulling out in the dingey,&rdquo;
grinned Peterson, as we approached the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. &ldquo;Confound that deck-hand, he
might have got you drowned! I&rsquo;ll fire him,
sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking that over.
There was a great deal of confusion, and after
all, he may have thought that we had John
with us. Besides, he&rsquo;s only young, and he&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg&nbsp;339]</a></span>
human. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do, Peterson&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
dock him a month&rsquo;s wages, and I&rsquo;ll send
his wages to his mother. Meantime, let him
carry the wood and water for a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found it not difficult now to go aboard
the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, for, in the lessening seaway,
she rolled not so evilly. Peterson sprang to
the deck as the bow of our boat rose alongside
on a wave, and made fast our line. When Williams
and I had followed, we took a general
inventory of the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. All the deck
gear was gone, spare oars and spars, a canvas
or so, and some coils of rope. Beyond that,
there seemed no serious damage, unless the
hull had been injured by its pounding during
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mud-bank here, I think, Mr. Harry,&rdquo;
said Peterson. &ldquo;She may have ripped some of
her copper on the oyster reefs, but she seems
to bed full length and maybe she&rsquo;s not strained,
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the line of channel guides,&rdquo; said I,
pointing to a row of sticks driven into the mud
a couple of miles in length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;the channel&rsquo;s not
more than a biscuit toss from here. We came
right across it&mdash;if it hadn&rsquo;t been in the dark,
we&rsquo;d have gone through into the lee of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg&nbsp;340]</a></span>
island and been all right. Now as it is, we&rsquo;re
all wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we get that anchor up?&rdquo; grumbled
he. &ldquo;If we start the engines and try to crawl
up by the capstan, we couldn&rsquo;t pull her out of
the mud. If we put on a donkey engine we&rsquo;d
snatch the bow out of here before we could
lift the hook. And until we do, how are we
going to move her? There&rsquo;s the channel, but
it&rsquo;s as far as ever. We can&rsquo;t sweep her off, of
course, and we can&rsquo;t pole her off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Peterson,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us, by all
means, hope for the worst.&rdquo; I smiled, seeing
that he now was possessed of his normal gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we went on at full tide, and
hard aground at that. This wind is blowing
all the water out of C&ocirc;te Blanche. Of course,
if the wind should turn and drive in again, we
might move her, if we caught her at high tide
once more. Until that happens, I guess we&rsquo;re
anchored here for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The glass is rising now, Peterson,&rdquo; said I,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it may rise a little,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
of course the storm&rsquo;s gone by for the time.
But I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be any good
change of weather that&rsquo;ll hold, very soon. But
now, Williams and I&rsquo;ll go below and see if we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg&nbsp;341]</a></span>
can start a pump. I expect she&rsquo;s sprung a leak,
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shaking his head in much apprehension, the
old man made his way with Williams, first into
the engine-room. For my own part, I turned
toward my cabin door. All at once as I did
so it seemed to me I heard a sound. It came
again, a sort of a meek diffident sound, expectant
rather than complaining. And then I
heard an unmistakable scraping at the door.
Hastening, I flung it open. I was greeted with
a great whine of joy and trust, a shaggy form
leaped upon me, thrust its cold nose into my
face, gave me much greetings of whines, and
at length of a loud howl of joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partial!&rdquo; I cried, and caught him by the
paws as he put them on my shoulders and
rubbed his muzzle along my cheek, whimpering;
&ldquo;Partial! Oh, my dear chap, I say now,
I&rsquo;m glad to see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I had forgotten Partial
these three days, other things being on my
mind. Once more our amateurishness in shipwreck
had nearly cost us a life. Partial, no
doubt, had meekly waited at his usual place
until ordered to come out with the rest. We
had closed the doors and port-holes when we
left the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, and thus he had been
locked in.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg&nbsp;342]</a></span>
I sat down on one of the bench lockers with
Partial&rsquo;s head in my hand, and almost my eyes
became moist. &ldquo;Partial,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let me confess
the truth to you. The woman had maddened
me. I forgot you&mdash;I did, and will own
it now. It was a grave fault, my friend. I
do not ask you to forgive me, and all I can do
is to promise you such amend as lies in my
power. From now on, I promise you, you shall
go with me to all the ends of the earth. My
people shall be your people, till death do us
part. Do you hear me, Partial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered by springing up again and licking
my face and hands, whimpering excitedly,
glad that I had come at last. &ldquo;Dear Partial,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re no gladder than I am. And
what&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ve nothing to cost you penitence.
Come, we&rsquo;ll go to the dining-room and
see whether there&rsquo;s anything left to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed me now along the rolling deck,
and happily I was able to get him some scraps
for his breakfast. Peterson heard me talking,
and thrust up a head above the engine-room
hatch. He was as crestfallen as myself when
I showed him that, once more, we had been
forgetful and had left a friend while busy in
saving ourselves.</p>

<p>I went once more to my cabin&mdash;Peterson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg&nbsp;343]</a></span>
having discovered, apparently to his great regret,
that so far as could be determined, we
had not started a seam or smashed a timber
anywhere. I found a small tent among other
of my sporting equipment and tossed this out
to go in the long boat&rsquo;s cargo. Another fowling
piece and ammunition, my canvas hunting
coat and wading boots, followed. Even, I
caught down from a nail the only other pair of
trousers available in my wardrobe&mdash;for Davidson&rsquo;s
vast midship section comported ill with
my own. I found my watch in these other
trousers, and putting a hand in a pocket, fished
out also my portemonnaie. It had certain bills
in it&mdash;I presume two or three thousand dollars
in all, and I thrust these into my pocket. At
the bottom of the little purse,&mdash;among collar
buttons and other hard objects,&mdash;I found a
little round white object, and once more bethought
me of my pearl which I had won on
the far northern river, as it seemed to me many
years before&mdash;the pearl which, as I have said,
was to be known as the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>. I preserved
it now.</p>

<p>Peterson and Williams, meantime, were busy
in getting aboard a case or so of water&mdash;not
forgetting the ninety-three of which I reminded the
old man once more. Some additional stores of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg&nbsp;344]</a></span>
bacon and tea, and a case of eggs, were also
taken aboard. At length, with quite a little
cargo in the way of comforts, we embarked
once more and started for our rude encampment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may be here for a month,&rdquo; said Peterson
gloomily, looking at the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, now
rolling just a little, her keel fast full length in
the mud-bar. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ever going
to be any change of wind&mdash;it&rsquo;ll blow steadily
this way for a week, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume, Peterson,&rdquo; said I coolly, &ldquo;that
you don&rsquo;t see the sun breaking through the
clouds over there, at all. And I fancy that you
will not believe, either, that the sea is lulling
now. Very well, I don&rsquo;t want to make you
unhappy, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard Williams chuckling as he stooped
over his engine. Thus, chugging on merrily
with the long oily roll of the sea under us, we
presently once more ran our surf, and this time
had small difficulty in winning through, for,
once we felt the ground under us, we simply
sprang overboard and waded in, dragging the
boat with us, waist-deep sometimes in the flood,
but on the whole quite safe.</p>

<p>My two pirate mates came down to the
beach joyously, and helped us unload. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg&nbsp;345]</a></span>
seemed that they had made something of a
hunt already, for with much pride Jean now
displayed to me certain birds, proof of his own
prowess with his shotgun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s good to eat,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Regular
greenheads, like we get up North.&rdquo; I
looked at the string of birds, and saw that they
were mallards and teals, a couple of dozen at
least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie, fie!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I fear you&rsquo;ve been shooting
on the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I did! And here&rsquo;s four things that I
don&rsquo;t suppose are good to eat&mdash;they got kind
of snaky heads, and red-colored, too. Ain&rsquo;t no
ducks good to eat that ain&rsquo;t got green heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each man to his taste,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but if you
like, you may have the green heads, and I&rsquo;ll
take these with the auburn locks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! What are they?&rdquo; answered he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only canvasbacks,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and good fat
ones, too. What luck have you, Jimmy, my
son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I went along and helped carry things,&rdquo;
said L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got on a string?&rdquo; I
asked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; said he, flushing. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nothing
but a little turtle. It had funny marks on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg&nbsp;346]</a></span>
its back. I caught it in the grass over there
by the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something about Jimmy&rsquo;s little turtle interested
me, and I picked it up in my hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For amateur sportsmen, gentlemen,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing pretty well. Your funny little
turtle, Jimmy, is nothing but a diamond-back
terrapin. There are perhaps more of them on
this coast than anywhere else in the world to-day.
And Partial, here&mdash;that friend of ours
now leaping excitedly and joyously before
them, barking at this little turtle of Jimmy&rsquo;s&mdash;will
perhaps be able to help you find some
more of them in the grass&mdash;the market hunters
here hunt them with dogs, as perhaps you did
not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got some oysters, Sir,&rdquo; said Willy, coming
forward shyly and shamefacedly; and
showed me the cockpit of the duck boat pretty
well filled. The boy had, it seems, found a
reef of these in a brackish arm which made
inland, and dug them by the simple process of
stooping down below the surface of the water,
since he had no oyster tongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it looks as if we would fare
pretty well for lunch. John&rdquo;&mdash;and I called
my China boy&mdash;&ldquo;again I find renewed cause
for felicitations on your rescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg&nbsp;347]</a></span>
John stood looking at me blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You savee, John?&rdquo; said I, showing him one
of the canvasbacks, and he remarked mildly,
&ldquo;All litee.&rdquo; If anything, his lunch was better
than his breakfast, and when I saw him take
Jimmy&rsquo;s funny little turtle from him and examine
it with appraising eye, I felt fairly well
convinced that we should not suffer at the dinner
hour.</p>

<p>But though a certain gaiety now came to
others of the party as we sat about our midday
meal, warm now and well fed, and although
the boys excitedly made plans about putting
up the tent and furnishing it and going into
camp for the winter, I could not share their
eagerness. There was one other reticent figure
at our fireside. Helena sat silent, the head of
Partial in her lap. I felt resentment that she
should steal from me even my dog. At last,
having nothing better to do, I picked up my
gun, and slipping on my coat, started down the
beach, telling the boys that I was going alone,
perhaps too far for them to follow, with the
purpose of making some sort of an exploration
of the island.</p>

<p>Moody and depressed, not in the least well
satisfied with life, even with matters thus so
far more fortunate than we had so recently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg&nbsp;348]</a></span>
had reason to expect, I walked along the hard
sand, sometimes looking at the long lines of
wild fowl streaming in above the fresh-water
lagoon, but in reality thinking but little of
these. I did not at first hear the light step
which came behind me on the sand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg&nbsp;349]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS NO RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE
FAIR CAPTIVE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;H</span>ARRY!&rdquo; I heard her call, and turned
quickly. &ldquo;Harry, wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came hurrying up toward me. I felt
my color rise. Awkwardly, I stood waiting,
and did not greet her. I cast a quick glance
the other way down the beach. It would be a
hundred yards before the first bend of the
shore-line would carry us behind the tall rushes.
Meantime, we were in full sight of all.</p>

<p>Partial, who had followed me when I whistled,
now greeted her more joyously than did
his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said I dully; &ldquo;I suppose you came
to take away my dog from me, didn&rsquo;t you?
It was all that was left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she coloring. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know but what Partial might be hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I who am hungry, Helena,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;I have long been hungry&mdash;for a look, a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not smile, showed not any trace of
coquetry in her mien, but paced on with me
now down the beach. I suppose she knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg&nbsp;350]</a></span>
when we had turned the point of rushes, for
now she laid her hand on my rough canvas
sleeve. It must have cost her effort to do that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; said she
after a time, since I still remained moodily
staring ahead. I did not answer, would not
look at her for a time, but at length she
turned. She stood, I say, with her hand on
my arm, her chin raised fully, her serious eyes
fixed on me. The dark hair was blown all
about her face. She had on over her long
white sweater a loose silk waterproof of some
sort, which blew every way, but did not disturb
the lines of her tall figure, nor lessen the
pale red and white which the sea breeze had
stung into her cheeks. She did not smile, and
her eyes, I say, looked steadily and seriously
into mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; she asked, frowning
slightly, as it seemed to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything in the world is wrong with me,
as you know very well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Am I not
a poor man? Am I not an unsuccessful lover?
Am I not a failure under every test which you
can apply? Am I not a coward&mdash;did you not
tell me so yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes grew damp slowly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
it,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg&nbsp;351]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then why did you say it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was long before&mdash;that was before last
night, Harry. You forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if it was?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;I was the
same man then that I was last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it, Harry,&rdquo; said she, her voice
low. Her hand was still on my arm. Her eye
now was cast down, the tip of her toe was
tracing a circle on the wet sand where we
stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said she, after a little while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume not,&rdquo; said I coldly. &ldquo;Sometimes
women do not stop to think. You have not
stopped to think that there is a limit even to
what my love would stand, Helena. Now,
much as I love you&mdash;and I never loved you so
much as I do now&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never again ask you
for what you can not give me. I&rsquo;ve been
rubbed the wrong way all I can stand, and
I&rsquo;ll not have it any more. I&rsquo;ve brought you
here, yes, and I&rsquo;m sorry enough for it. But
I&rsquo;m going to fix all that now, soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Harry?&rdquo; she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder, across the bay,&rdquo; said I, pointing,
&ldquo;runs a channel. That&rsquo;s the Cheni&egrave;re. I presume
the lighthouse boats come from in there.
Maybe there&rsquo;ll be one down after the storm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg&nbsp;352]</a></span>
in a day or so. He&rsquo;ll take out a message, and
get it on some boat bound for Morgan City,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I shall send out any message you
like, beside my own message to the parents of
these boys of mine. And I&rsquo;ll send a message,
too, to my friend, Manning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her eyes where I pointed once
more, this time seemingly northward across
the bay. &ldquo;Yonder is still another channel,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;not twenty miles from where we stand.
It runs back to the live-oak islands where my
friend Manning has his plantation. If the
tide serves and we can get the yacht afloat,
it won&rsquo;t take us long to get in there. Once
there, you are safe; and once there, I say good-by.
Judge for yourself whether or not this is
the last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when will that be, Harry?&rdquo; she demanded,
still tracing some figure on the sand
with the toe of her little boot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, I have said, is something I can not
tell. But as soon as possible, rest assured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent now, confused, a little abashed,
a mood entirely new to her in my recollection
of her many moods. Her hand still lay
upon my coarse canvas sleeve as though she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg&nbsp;353]</a></span>
had forgotten it. I bent now and kissed it.
&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said she in a whisper, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
care for me any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to the camp, Helena,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you
know I do, but I&rsquo;ve done enough for you, and
I&rsquo;ll do no more. All a coward can do to keep
you safe I have done, but I&rsquo;m no such coward
as to follow you around now and dangle at
your apron strings. It&rsquo;s good-by once more.
What are you,&rdquo; I demanded fiercely, once
more, &ldquo;that you should walk over my soul
again and again? Hasn&rsquo;t there got to be an
end to that sort of thing some time, and don&rsquo;t
you think there is an end for me? Go back
and tell your aunt that you have won. And
much joy may you both have in your winning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I kissed her hand, flung it off, turned and
went down the beach. She did not look about,
but presently as I saw, turned and went back
toward the camp, her head hanging. And, as
I had said to her, I never loved her so much
in all my life, though never was I so little disposed
to go one step in her pursuit.</p>

<p>Partial sat, looking after her also, his heart
torn in the division between us, for he loved
us both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partial,&rdquo; I called to him harshly, and he
came, his ears down and very unhappy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg&nbsp;354]</a></span>
Silently, the dog at my heels, I strode on down
the beach, and so I saw her no more for some
time.</p>

<p>I found for myself a driftwood log at the
edge of the sea-marsh, and here for a time I sat
down, moodily staring out across the bay, as
unhappy, I fancy, as man gets to be in this
world. I scarce know how long I sat here, in
the wind which blew salt across the bay, and
for some time, I paid no attention to the
clamoring fowl which passed and repassed not
far from my point.</p>

<p>At length, a long harrow of great Canadian
geese passed so close to me that without much
thought about it, I raised the gun and fired.
I killed two birds, and as I picked them up I
found they were not a brace, but a pair. The
report of my gun started a clamoring of all
manner of fowl beyond the edge of reeds which
hid the reef. A cloud of ducks passed before
me, and slipping in the shells once more, I
fired right and left. Again I killed my brace,
and again when I picked them up they were
a pair. The head of one was green, the other
brown. &ldquo;Male and female made He them!&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;If I had not killed these birds, in the
spring they would have gone northward, to
the edge of the world in their own love-making,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg&nbsp;355]</a></span>
thousands of miles from here.&rdquo; I looked at
my quarry with remorse, and not caring to
shoot more, at length picked up the birds and
slowly started back to camp, not looking forward
with any too great pleasure, it may be
imagined, to further meetings with the woman
whom, of all the world, I most cared to meet.</p>

<p>I found all the others of the party amiably
engaged in camp affairs. The tent now was
up, the fire was arranged in more practical
fashion, and John was busy with his pans. Lafitte,
ever resourceful and ever busy, was out
with Willy after more oysters. L&rsquo;Olonnois, his
partner, seemed engaged in some sort of argument
with his Auntie Helena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I heard her say. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t any sugar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s plenty of sugar, ain&rsquo;t
there, John?&rdquo; And that worthy smiled as he
pointed toward an open canister of that dainty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any pan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have, too, got a pan. Here&rsquo;s one
a-settin&rsquo; right here in front of you. Come on
now, Auntie. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have duck and
terrapin and oysters and everything&mdash;all a fellow
would want, besides that, is just fudges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helena stood preoccupied and hesitant, hardly
hearing what he said, as I fancy. At once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg&nbsp;356]</a></span>
L&rsquo;Olonnois&rsquo; attitude changed. Folding his arms,
he turned toward her sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woman!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you not a captive
to our band? Then who gives orders here?
Either you make fudges, or your life&rsquo;s blood
stains these sands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, Jimmy,&rdquo; she said listlessly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make them, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; remarked that worthy sententiously.
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added, seeking to
mollify his victim, over whom he thus domineered,
&ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t just like it is back home on
the stove, but you&rsquo;ll have to get used to that,
because we&rsquo;re going to live here forever. And,&rdquo;
he added, casting a glance of his stern blue
eyes upon her, &ldquo;it is the part of the captive
maid ever to live happily with the chief of the
pirate band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon Helena and Jimmy both looked
up and saw me standing, unwilling listener to
all that had been said. Helena moved away
and pretended to be busy with the material
for her confections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, shucks, Black Bart,&rdquo; said Jimmy, turning
to me&mdash;&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t that just like a woman?&mdash;They
won&rsquo;t never play the game.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH I FIND TWO ESTIMABLE FRIENDS, BUT
LOSE ONE BELOVED</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE weather now, moderating, after the
fashion of weather on this coast, as rapidly
as it had become inclement, we passed a
more comfortable night on our desert island.
No doubt the lighthouse tender knew of our
presence, for he easily could see our tent by
day and our fire by night, and he surely must
have seen our good ship riding at anchor under
his nose at the edge of the channel; but no
visit came from that official&mdash;for the very good
reason, as we later learned, that the storm
had stove in his boat at her mooring; so that
all he himself could do was to cross his Cajun
bosom and pray that his supply skiff might
come from across the bay. So, as much alone
as the Swiss family by name of Robinson&mdash;an
odd name for a Swiss family, it always seemed
to me&mdash;we remained on our desert island undisturbed,
the ladies now in the comfortable
tent, my hardy pirates under the tarpaulin, and
the rest of us as we liked or might, all in beds
of the sweet scented grasses which grew along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg&nbsp;358]</a></span>
the lagoon where the great ranks of wild fowl
kept up their chatter day and night.</p>

<p>It was a land of plenty, and any but a man
in my situation might well have been content
there for many days. Content was not in my
own soul. I was up by dawn and busy about
the boats, before any sign of life was visible
around the tent or the canvas shelter. But
since the sun rose warm, it yet was early when
we met at John&rsquo;s breakfast fire. I felt myself
a shabby figure, for in my haste I had forgotten
my razors; and by now my clothing was
sadly soiled and stained, even the most famous
of the Davidson waistcoats being the worse
for the salt-water immersions it had known;
and my ancient flannels were corkscrewing
about my limbs. But as for Helena, young
and vital, she discarded her sweater for breakfast,
and appeared as she had before the shipwreck,
in lace bridge coat and wearing many
gems! L&rsquo;Olonnois, with the intimacy of kin
and the admiration of youth&mdash;and with youth&rsquo;s
lack of tact&mdash;saluted her now gaily. &ldquo;Gee!
Auntie,&rdquo; said he, at table on the sand, &ldquo;togged
out that way, all them glitterin&rsquo; gems, you
shore look fit for a pirate&rsquo;s bride!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Helena! She blushed red to the hair;
and I fear I did no better myself. &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo;
reproved Aunt Lucinda.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg&nbsp;359]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo;!&rdquo; rejoined that hopeful.
&ldquo;My name is L&rsquo;Olonnois, the Scourge of
The Sea. Me an&rsquo; Jean Lafitte, we follow Black
Bart the Avenger, to the Spanish Main.
Auntie, pass me the bacon, please. I&rsquo;m just about
starved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Daniver, as was her custom, ate a very
substantial breakfast; Helena, almost none at
all; nor had I much taste for food. In some
way, our constraint insensibly extended to all
the party, much to L&rsquo;Olonnois&rsquo; disgust. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
<em>her</em> fault!&rdquo; I overheard him say to his mate.
&ldquo;Women can&rsquo;t play no games. An&rsquo; we was
havin&rsquo; such a bully chance! Now, like&rsquo;s not,
we won&rsquo;t stay here longer&rsquo;n it&rsquo;ll take to get
things back to the boat again. I don&rsquo;t want to
go back home&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather be a pirate; an&rsquo; so&rsquo;d
any fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure he would,&rdquo; assented Jean. They did
not see me, behind the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; began L&rsquo;Olonnois, portentously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you guess?&rdquo; queried Lafitte. &ldquo;Looks
to me like it was somethin&rsquo; between him an&rsquo;
the fair captive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it&mdash;that&rsquo;s just what I said!
Now, if Black Bart lets his whiskers grow, an&rsquo;
Auntie Helena wears them rings, ain&rsquo;t it just
like in the book? Course it is! But here they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg&nbsp;360]</a></span>
go, don&rsquo;t eat nothin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t talk none to nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what!&rdquo; began Lafitte.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh, what?&rdquo; demanded L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great wrong has been did our brave
leader by yon heartless jade; that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You betcher life they has. He&rsquo;s on the
square, an&rsquo; look what he done for us&mdash;look
how he managed things all the way down to
here. Anybody else couldn&rsquo;t have got away
with this. Anybody else&rsquo;d never a&rsquo; went out
there last night after John, just a Chink, thataway.
An&rsquo; her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy&rsquo;s disapproval of his auntie, as thus
expressed, was extreme. I was now about to
step away, but feared detection, so unwillingly
heard on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t see no one else but yon fickle
jade!&rdquo; commented Jean Lafitte, &ldquo;unworthy as
she is of a bold chief&rsquo;s regard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to make all the
trouble. I&rsquo;ll tell you what!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to fix it up, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, reason it out with &rsquo;em both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean apparently shook his head, or had some
look of dubiousness, for L&rsquo;Olonnois went on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg&nbsp;361]</a></span>
&ldquo;We <em>gotta</em> do it, somehow. If we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll
about have to go back home; an&rsquo; who wants to
go back home from a good old desert island like
this here. <em>So</em> now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you, now. You see, I got
some pull with her&mdash;the fair captive. She
used to lick me, but she don&rsquo;t dast to try it on
here on a desert island: so I got some pull.
An&rsquo; like enough you c&rsquo;d talk it over with Black
Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nuh&mdash;uh! I don&rsquo;t like to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we got to get &rsquo;em <em>together</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shore. But, my idea, he&rsquo;s hard to <em>get</em> together
if he gets a notion he ain&rsquo;t had a square
deal nohow, someways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t. So that makes my part the
hardest. But you just go to him, and tell him
not to hurry, because you are informed the fair
captive is goin&rsquo; to relent, pretty soon, if we
just don&rsquo;t get in too big a hurry and run away
from a place like this&mdash;where the duck shootin&rsquo;
is immense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But kin you work <em>her</em>, Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno. She&rsquo;s pretty set, if she
thinks she ain&rsquo;t had a square deal, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg&nbsp;362]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; argued Lafitte, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s the
way they both feel, either they&rsquo;re both wrong
an&rsquo; ought to shake hands, or else one of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s
wrong, and they either ought to get together
an&rsquo; find out which it was, or else they ought
to leave it to some one else to say which one
<em>was</em> wrong. Ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course it&rsquo;s so. So now, thing fer us
fellows to do, is just to put it before &rsquo;em
plain, an&rsquo; get &rsquo;em both to leave it to us two
fellers what&rsquo;s right fer &rsquo;em both to do. Now,
<em>I</em> think they&rsquo;d ought to get married, both of
&rsquo;em&mdash;I mean to each other, you know. Folks
<em>does</em> get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Bart would,&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bet anything. The fair captive, she&rsquo;s a heartless
jade, but I seen Black Bart lookin&rsquo; at her,
an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I seen her lookin&rsquo; at him&mdash;leastways a
picture&mdash;an&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;Jimmy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; It was I, myself, red and angry,
who now broke from my unwilling eavesdropping.</p>

<p>The two boys turned to me innocently. I
found it difficult to say anything at all, and
wisest to say nothing. &ldquo;I was just going to
ask if you two wouldn&rsquo;t like to take the guns
and go out after some more ducks&mdash;especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg&nbsp;363]</a></span>
the kind with red heads and flat noses, such as
we had yesterday. And I&rsquo;ll lend you Partial,
so you can try for some more of those funny
little turtles. I&rsquo;ll have to go out to the ship,
and also over to the lighthouse, before long.
The tide will turn, perhaps, and at least the
wind is offshore from the island now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; Jean spoke for both at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. And be careful. And you&rsquo;d&mdash;you&rsquo;d
better leave your auntie and her
auntie alone, Jimmy&mdash;they&rsquo;ll want to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear us sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;, did you,
Black Bart?&rdquo; asked L&rsquo;Olonnois, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I believe that&rsquo;s a boat beating
down the bay,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo; And so
eager were they that they forgot my omission
of direct reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely only the lighthouse supply
boat coming in,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out over
there. Better run along, or the morning flight
of the birds will be over.&rdquo; So they ran along.</p>

<p>As for myself, I called Peterson and Williams
for another visit to our disabled ship, which
now lay on a level keel, white and glistening,
rocking gently in the bright wind. I left word
for the ladies that we might not be back for
luncheon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg&nbsp;364]</a></span>
We found that the piling waters of C&ocirc;te
Blanche, erstwhile blown out to sea, were now
slowly settling back again after the offshore
storm. The <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> had risen from her
bed in the mud now and rode free. Our
soundings showed us that it would be easy
now to break out the anchor and reach the
channel, just ahead. So, finding no leak of consequence,
and the beloved engines not the
worse for wear, Williams went below to get
up some power, while Peterson took the wheel
and I went forward to the capstan.</p>

<p>The donkey winch soon began its work, and
I felt the great anchor at length break away
and come apeak. The current of the air swung
us before we had all made fast; and as I
sounded with a long bow pike, I presently
called out to Peterson, &ldquo;No bottom!&rdquo; He nodded;
and now, slowly, we took the channel and
moved on in opposite the light. We could see
the white-capped gulf rolling beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water there!&rdquo; said Peterson. &ldquo;We can go
on through, come around in the Morrison cut-off,
and so make the end of the Manning channel
to the mainland. But I wish we had a
local pilot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Drop her in alongside this fellow&rsquo;s
wharf,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;The ladies have sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg&nbsp;365]</a></span>
some letters&mdash;to go out by the tender&rsquo;s boat,
yonder&mdash;I suppose he&rsquo;ll be going back to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said Peterson; and so gently
we moved on up the dredged channel, and at
last made fast at the tumble-down wharf of
the lighthouse; courteously waiting for the
little craft of the tender to make its landing.</p>

<p>We found the mooring none too good, what
with the storm&rsquo;s work at the wharf, and as we
shifted our lines a time or two, the gaping,
jeans-clad Cajun who had come in with mail
and supplies passed in to the lighthouse ahead
of us; and I wonder his head did not twist
quite off its neck, for though he walked forward,
he ever looked behind him.</p>

<p>When at length we two, Peterson and myself,
passed up the rickety walk to the equally
rickety gallery at the foot of the light, we
found two very badly frightened men instead
of a single curious one. The keeper in sooth
had in hand a muzzle-loading shotgun of such
extreme age, connected with such extreme
length of barrel, as might have led one to suspect
it had grown an inch or so annually for
all of many decades. He was too much frightened
to make active resistance, however, and
only warned us away, himself, now, a pale
saffron in color.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg&nbsp;366]</a></span>
&ldquo;Keep hout!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll
didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll didn&rsquo;t what, my friend?&rdquo; began I
mildly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like my looks? Not that
I blame you if you do not. But has the boat
brought down any milk or eggs that you can
spare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No milluk&mdash;no haig!&rdquo; muttered the light
tender; and they would have closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come now, my friends!&rdquo; I rejoined
testily. &ldquo;Suppose you haven&rsquo;t, you can at least
be civil. I want to talk with you a minute.
This is the power yacht <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>, of Mackinaw,
cruising on the Gulf. We went aground
in the storm; and all we want now is to send
out a little mail by you to Morgan City, or
wherever you go; and to pass the time of day
with you, as friends should. What&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;do
you think us a government revenue boat,
and are you smuggling stuff from Cuba through
the light here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We no make hany smug&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied the
keeper. &ldquo;But we know you, who you been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smote now upon an open newspaper,
whose wrapper still lay on the floor. I glanced,
and this time I saw a half-page cut of the
<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> herself, together with portraits of
myself, Mrs. Daniver, Miss Emory and two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg&nbsp;367]</a></span>
wholly imaginary and fearsome boys who very
likely were made up from newspaper portraits
of the James Brothers! Moreover, my hasty
glance caught sight of a line in large letters,
reading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Ten Thousand Dollars Reward!</span></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I calmly, handing him the
paper, &ldquo;they seem to be after us, and to value
us rather high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced, his eyes eager; but Peterson,
while a professional doubter, was personally a
man of whose loyalty and whose courage I,
myself, had not the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em come!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our
own way and about our own business; and outside
the three mile zone, let &rsquo;em follow us on
the high seas if they like. She&rsquo;s sound as a
bell, Mr. Harry, and once we get her docked
and her port shaft straight, there&rsquo;s nothing can
touch her on the Gulf. Let &rsquo;em come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t dock here, my good Peterson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we can beat &rsquo;em with one engine and
one screw. Besides, what have we done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haint you was &rsquo;hrobber, han ron hoff with
those sheep?&rdquo; demanded the keeper excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we are not ship thieves but gentlemen,
my friend,&rdquo; I answered, suddenly catching at
his long gun and setting it behind me. &ldquo;You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg&nbsp;368]</a></span>
might let that go off,&rdquo; I explained. At which
he went yellower than ever, a thing I had
thought impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Suppose we are
robbers, pirates, what you like, and suppose a
price is put on our heads&mdash;a price which means
a jolly nice libel suit for each paper printing
it, by the way, or a jolly nice apology&mdash;none
the less, we are a strong band and without
fear either of the law or of you. Here you
are alone, and not a sail is in sight. If any
boat did come here, we could&mdash;well, we could
blow her out of the water, couldn&rsquo;t we, Peterson?
We could blow you out of the water,
too, couldn&rsquo;t we, we and these ruffians of our
crew?&rdquo;&mdash;and I pointed at the two low-browed
pictures of Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois.</p>

<p>A shudder was my only answer. I think the
two portraits of my young bullies did the business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;it is plain,
Messieurs, that there is many a slip between
the reward and the pocket, <i>voyez vous</i>? <i>Bien!</i>
But here&mdash;&rdquo; and I thrust a hand into my pocket&mdash;&ldquo;is
a reward much closer home, and far easier to
attain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their eyes bulged as they saw two or three
thousand dollars in big bills smoothed out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg&nbsp;369]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>Ecoutez, Messieurs!</i>&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Behold here
not enemies, but men of like mind. I speak of
men who live by the sea, men of the old home
of Jean Lafitte, that great merchant, that bold
soldier, who did so much to save his country
at the Battle. Even now he has thousands of
friends and hundreds of relatives in this land.
You yourself, I doubt not, Messieurs, are distant
cousins of Jean Lafitte? <i>N&rsquo;est-ce pas?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>They crossed themselves, but murmured &ldquo;<i>Ba-oui!</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;Est ees the trut&rsquo;! How did Monsieur
know?&rdquo; asked the tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know many things. I know that any
cousin descended from those brave days loves
the sea and its ways more than he loves the
law. And if money has come easy&mdash;as this
did&mdash;what harm if a cousin should take the
price of a rat-skin or two and carry out a letter
or so to the railway, and keep a close mouth
about it as well? To the good old days, and
Messieurs, my friends!&rdquo; I had seen the neck
of a flask in Peterson&rsquo;s pocket, and now I took
it forth, unscrewed the top, and passed it, with
two bills of one hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>They poured, grinned. I stood, waiting for
their slow brains to act, but there was only a
foregone answer. The keeper drank first, as
ranking his tender; the other followed; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg&nbsp;370]</a></span>
they handed the flask&mdash;not the bills&mdash;back to
Peterson and me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci, mes amis!</i>&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And I drink to
Jean Lafitte and the old days! Perhaps, you
may buy a mass for your cousin&rsquo;s soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah non!</i>&rdquo; answered the keeper. &ldquo;Hees soul
she&rsquo;s hout of <i>Purgatoire</i> long hago eef she&rsquo;ll goin&rsquo;
get hout. Me, I buy me some net for s&rsquo;rimp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; me, two harpent more lan&rsquo; for my
farm,&rdquo; quoth the tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! poor Jean!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But he was so
virtuous a man that he needs no masses after
a hundred years, perhaps. As you like. You
will take the letters; and this for the telegraph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain&rsquo;! I&rsquo;ll took it those,&rdquo; answered the
tender. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stayed for dish coffee, yass?&rdquo;
inquired the keeper, with Cajun hospitality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I fear it is not possible, thank you,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;We must be going soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; where you&rsquo;ll goin&rsquo;, Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Around the island, up the channel, up the
old oyster-boat channel of Monsieur Edouard.
The letters are some of them for Monsieur
Edouard himself. And you know well, <i>mes
amis</i>, that once we lie at the wharf of Monsieur
Edouard, not the government even of the state
will touch us yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg&nbsp;371]</a></span>
&ldquo;My faith, <em>non!</em> I should say it&mdash;certain&rsquo; not!
No man he&rsquo;ll mawnkey wit&rsquo; Monsieur Edouard,
heem! You&rsquo;ll was know him, Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went to school together. We smoked
the same pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My faith! You&rsquo;ll know Monsieur Edouard!&rdquo;
The keeper shook my hand. &ldquo;H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll
was work for Monsieur Edouard manny tam
hon hees boat, hon hees plantation, hon hees
&rsquo;ouse. When I&rsquo;ll want some leetle money,
s&rsquo;pose those hrat he&rsquo;ll wasn&rsquo;t been prime yet,
hall H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll need was to go non Monsieur Edouard,
hask for those leetle monny. He&rsquo;ll
han&rsquo; it on me, yass, heem, ten dollar, jus&rsquo; like
as heasy Monsieur has gave it me hondred dollar
now, yas, heem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes? Well, I know that a cousin of Jean
Lafitte&mdash;who no doubt has dug for treasure all
over the dooryard of Monsieur Edouard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not behin&rsquo; the smoke-house&mdash;nevair on
dose place yet, I&rsquo;ll swear it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Very well, suppose you have not yet included
the smoke-house of Monsieur Edouard,
at least you are his friend. And what Acadian
lives who is not a friend of the ladies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain&rsquo;, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well again. What you see in the paper
is all false. The two ladies whose pictures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg&nbsp;372]</a></span>
you see here, and here, are yonder at our camp.
You shall come and see that they are well and
happy, both of them. Moreover, if you like
another fifty for the mass for Jean Lafitte&rsquo;s
soul, you, yourself, my friend, shall pilot us
into the channel of Monsieur Edouard. We&rsquo;ll
tow your boat behind us across the bay. Is it
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certain&rsquo;! <i>oui!</i>&rdquo; answered the tender. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;ll had leetle dish coffee quite plain?&rdquo; once
more demanded the lonesome keeper; and for
sake of his hospitable soul we now said yes;
and very good coffee it was, too: and the better
since I knew it meant we now were friends.
Ah! pirate blood is far thicker than any water
you may find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if we take you on as pilot, my friend,&rdquo;
said I to the pilot as at length we arose, &ldquo;how
shall we get out our letters after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thass hall right,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;my cousin,
Richard Barri&egrave;re&mdash;she&rsquo;s cousin of Jean Lafitte
too, heem&mdash;she&rsquo;ll was my partner on the s&rsquo;rimp,
an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll was come hon the light, here, heem,
to-mor&rsquo;, yas, heem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And would you give the letters to Mr. Richard
Barri&egrave;re to-morrow?&rdquo; I inquired of the
lighthouse keeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui, oui</i>, certain&rsquo;, <i>assurement</i>, wit&rsquo; <i>plaisir,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg&nbsp;373]</a></span>
Monsieur</i>,&rdquo; he replied. So I handed him the little
packet.</p>

<p>It chanced that my eye caught sight of one
of the two letters Mrs. Daniver had handed
me. The address was not in Mrs. Daniver&rsquo;s
handwriting, but one that I knew very well.
And the letter, in this handwriting that I knew
very well, was addressed to Calvin Horace
Davidson, Esquire, The Boston Club, New Orleans,
Louisiana: all written out in full in Helena&rsquo;s
own scrupulous fashion.</p>

<p>I gave the letter over to the messenger, but
for a time I stood silent, thinking. I knew now
very well what that letter contained. But yesterday,
Helena Emory had finally decided, there
on the beach, alone with me, the salt air on
her cheek, the salt tears in her eyes. She had
gone far as woman might to tell me that she
was grieved over a hasty word&mdash;she had given
me a chance, my first chance, my only chance,
my last chance. And, I, pig-headed fool, had
slighted her at the very moment of moments
of all my life&mdash;I who had prided myself on
my &ldquo;psychology&rdquo;&mdash;I who had thought myself
wise&mdash;I had allowed that woman to go away
with her head drooping when at last she&mdash;oh,
I saw it all plainly enough now! And now
indeed small psychology and small wit were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg&nbsp;374]</a></span>
requisite to know the whole process of a
woman&rsquo;s soul, thus chilled. She had been hesitant,
had been a little resentful of this runaway
situation, had not liked my domineering ways;
but at last she had relented and had asked my
pardon. Then I had spurned her. And then
her mind swung to the other man. She had
not yet given that man his answer, but when
I chilled her, rejected her timid little desire to
&ldquo;make up&rdquo; with me&mdash;why, then, her mind was
made up for that other man at once. She had
written his answer. And now&mdash;oh! fiendlike
cruelty of woman&rsquo;s heart&mdash;she had chosen me
as her messenger to carry out that word which
would cost me herself forever! She had done
that exquisitely well, as she did everything, not
even advising me that I was to be her errand
boy on such an errand, trusting me to find out
by accident, as I had, that I was to be my own
executioner, was to spring my own guillotine.
She knew that, none the less, though I understood
what the letter meant thus addressed, I
sacredly must execute her silent trust. Oh!
Helena, yours was indeed an exquisite revenge
for that one hour of a dour man&rsquo;s hurt pride.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH WE FOLD OUR TENTS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>Y consent of the lighthouse keeper, we left
the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> moored at the wharf in
the channel, with Williams in charge, while
Peterson and I, towing the tender&rsquo;s sailing
skiff, its piratical lateen sail lowered, started
back for our encampment in our long boat.
It was only a half mile or so alongshore around
the head of the island, although we had to keep
out a bit to avoid going aground on the flats
where the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> had come to grief&mdash;and
had, moreover, to wade ashore some fifty yards
or so, now that the sea was calm, since the
keel of the motor-boat would not admit a
closer approach in the shallows.</p>

<p>We found our party all assembled, John having
but now issued his luncheon call; and, such
had proved the swift spell of this care-free life,
none expressed much delight at the announcement
of my decision to strike camp and move
toward civilization. Helena only looked up
swiftly, but made no comment; and Mrs. Daniver,
to my surprise, openly rebelled at leaving
these flesh-pots, where canvasback and terrapin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg&nbsp;376]</a></span>
might be had by shaking the bushes, and where
the supply of ninety-three seemed, after all, not exhausted.
Of course, my men had nothing to
say about it, but when it came to my partners
and associates, Lafitte and L&rsquo;Olonnois, there was
open mutiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, now,&rdquo; protested L&rsquo;Olonnois, his lip
quivering, &ldquo;O&rsquo; <em>course</em> we don&rsquo;t want to go home.
Ain&rsquo;t our desert island all right? Where you
goin&rsquo; to find any better place &rsquo;n this, like to
know? Besides&rdquo;&mdash;and here he drew me to one
side&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;s a good reason for not goin&rsquo; just
yet, Black Bart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Jimmy?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> know somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jean Lafitte knows it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t happened yet, but it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to&mdash;or anyhow maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You interest me! Is it a matter of importance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Say it was!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to you&mdash;an&rsquo; besides, to my Auntie
Helena. &rsquo;N&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t pull off things like that
just anywheres. Jean Lafitte an&rsquo; me, we frame
up how to handle yon heartless jade, the fair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg&nbsp;377]</a></span>
captive, &rsquo;n&rsquo; here you butt in &rsquo;n&rsquo; spoil the whole
works. It ain&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bethought me now of the conversation I
had unwillingly overheard&mdash;and my heart was
grateful to these my friends&mdash;but the next instant
I remembered the note to Cal Davidson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Jimmy, my friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
I believe I know what you mean, but it can&rsquo;t
be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; why can&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the&mdash;the frame-up that you have just
mentioned. In short&mdash;but, Jimmy, go on and
roll up the blankets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why can&rsquo;t it, and what do you know
about it? Tell me,&rdquo; he demanded with sudden
inspiration, &ldquo;is yon varlet a suitor, too, for
yon heartless jade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decline to answer, Jimmy. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s get
into too deep water. Go on and get your bundles
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine pirate, ain&rsquo;t you, Black Bart!&rdquo;
he broke out. &ldquo;Do you hold yerself fit to head
a band o&rsquo; bold an&rsquo; desprit men, when you let
yerself be bluffed by yon varlet, an&rsquo; him a thousand
miles away? You try <em>me</em>, just you gimme
a desert island, or even a pirut ship, a week,
like the chance you got, an&rsquo; beshrew me, but
any heartless jade would be mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg&nbsp;378]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, maybe not, Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Or else she&rsquo;d walk the plank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any plank to walk here, Jimmy,&rdquo;
said I, pointing to our boat, which lay in the
shoals far out. &ldquo;I rather wish there were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to carry my Auntie Helen out
on yore strong right arm, Black Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort, Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like her no more? An&rsquo; if you
don&rsquo;t, what&rsquo;re we here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could foresee embarrassments in further
conversation with Jimmy in his present truculent
mood, so sought out others less mutinous,
and gave orders for the striking of the camp
and the embarkment of all in the small boats.
I left Peterson and Willy to take the ladies
and most of the duffel in the large boat, assigned
John the dingey for his cook boat, and
decided to pole the light draft duck boat over
the shallows direct to the yacht, taking my two
associates with me. It was necessary, of
course, to carry our fair passengers out to the
long boat, which was some distance out on the
flat beach. Peterson and I made a cradle for
Mrs. Daniver, with our locked hands, and so
got her substantial weight aboard. Helena
mutely waited, but seeing her so, and unwilling
myself to be so near to her any more, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg&nbsp;379]</a></span>
motioned her to step into the flat duck boat, dry
shod, and so poled her out to the long boat;
but I did so in silence, nor did she look up or
speak to me.</p>

<p>Our new pilot sat in his own boat, and was
towed back, after rendering some assistance
with the cargoes; so now, at last, I was ready
to leave a spot which, in any other circumstances,
would have offered much charm for a
man fond of the out-of-doors. As for my
young friends, they were almost in tears as
they sat, looking back longingly at the great
flights of all manner of wild fowl continuously
streaming in and out of the lagoon. At any
other time, I would have been unwilling as
any to depart, but, now, the whole taste and
flavor of life had left me, and no interest remained
in any of my old occupations or enjoyments.
All that remained was the action necessary
to deliver Helena and her aunt back to
the usual scenes of their lives, to make their
losses as light as possible, to take my own
losses, and so close the books of my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they come!&rdquo; said Jean Lafitte, pointing
to a vast gaggle of clamoring wild geese
coming in from the bay. &ldquo;Right over our point,
Jimmy! Gee! I wisht I was under them fellers
right now. Pow! Pow!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg&nbsp;380]</a></span>
&ldquo;Aw, shut up!&rdquo; was Jimmy&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t never get no chance like this again.
Why, looky here, we was reg&rsquo;lar castaways on
a real desert island, an&rsquo; we had a abandoned
ship, an&rsquo; we c&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; lived chiefly by huntin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
fishin&rsquo;; and we had evaded all pursuit an&rsquo; run
off with the fair captive to a place o&rsquo; hidin&rsquo;&mdash;why,
it&rsquo;s all just like in the book. An&rsquo; what
do <em>we</em> do? Why, we go home! Wouldn&rsquo;t it
frost you? An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s worse, we let the heartless
jade get away with it, too! Ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true, Jimmy,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was talkin&rsquo; to Jean Lafitte&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
so. We started out all right as pirates, but
now we let a girl bluff us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you do, Jimmy, in a case like
that?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would wring the wench&rsquo;s slender neck,
beshrew me! She couldn&rsquo;t put over none o&rsquo;
that coarse work on me. No, curses on her
fair face!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do, Jimmy!&rdquo; said I, and pushed
on in silence, Jean Lafitte very grave, and Jimmy
snuffling, now, in his grief at leaving the
enchanted island. So, all much about the same
time, we reached the <i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i> and went
aboard. The ladies went at once to their cabin,
and I saw neither again that day, although I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg&nbsp;381]</a></span>
sent down duck, terrapin and ninety-three for their
dinner that night.</p>

<p>In half an hour we were under way; and in
an hour and a half, having circumvented our
long desert island, we were passing through
the cut-off which led us back into C&ocirc;te Blanche,
some fifty miles, I presume, from what was to
be our voyage&rsquo;s end. We still were in the vast
marsh country, an inaccessible region teeming
with wild life. The sky now was clear, the
air once more warm, the breeze gentle, and
all the country roundabout us had a charm
quite its own. A thousand side channels led
back into the fortresses of the great sea-marsh,
to this or that of the many lakes, lagoons and
pond holes where the wild fowl found their feeding
beds. Here was this refuge, where they
fled to escape persecution, the spot most remote,
secluded, secret, inaccessible. Here nature
conspired to balk pursuit. The wide shallows
made a bar now to the average sailing
craft, and as for a motor-yacht like ours, the
presence of a local pilot, acquainted with all
the oyster reefs and shallows, all the channels
and cut-offs, made us feel more easy, for we
knew we could no longer sail merely by compass
and chart. A great sense of remoteness
from all the world came over me. I scarce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg&nbsp;382]</a></span>
could realize that yonder, so lately left behind,
roared the mad tumult of the northern cities.
This wide expanse was broken by no structure
dedicated to commerce, not even the quiet spire
of some rural church arose among the lesser
edifices of any village&mdash;not even the blue smoke
of some farmhouse marked the dwelling-place
of man. It was the wilderness, fit only for the
nomad, fit only for the man resentful of restraint
and custom, longing only for the freedom
of adventure and romance. The cycles of
Cathay lay here in these gray silences, the leaf
of the lotus pulsed on this lazy sea. Ah! here,
here indeed were surcease and calm.</p>

<p>And all this I was leaving. I was going
back now to the vast tumult of the roaring
towns, to the lip of mockery, the eye of insincerity,
the hand of hypocrisy, where none may
trust a neighbor. And moreover, I was going
back without one look, face to face, into the
eyes and the heart of the woman I had loved,
and who, by force of these extraordinary circumstances
had, for a miraculous moment,
been thus set down with me, her lover, in the
very surroundings built of Providence for secrecy
and love! Yonder, speeding to her summons,
no doubt hastened, ready to meet her,
the man whom she had preferred above me.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg&nbsp;383]</a></span>
And like a beast of burden, driven in the service
of these two, I was plodding on, in the
work of leaving paradise and opportunity, and
delivering safe into the hands of another man
the woman whom I loved far more than all else
in all the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS PHILOSOPHY; WHICH, HOWEVER,
SHOULD NOT BE SKIPPED</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E passed on steadily to the northward
until mid-afternoon, making no great
headway with one propellor missing, but leaving
the main gulf steadily, and at length, raising,
a faint blue loom on the sky, the long oak-crowned
heights of those singular geological
formations, the heights known as &ldquo;islands&rdquo;,
that bound the head of this great bay. Here
the land, springing out of the level marshes
and alluvial wet prairies, thrusts up in long
reefs, hundreds of feet above the sea level. On
the eminences grow ancient and mossy forest
trees, as well as much half-tropic brake in the
lower levels. Here are wide and rich acres
also, owned as hereditary fees by old proud
families, part of whose wealth comes from their
plantations, part from their bay fisheries, and
much from the ancient salt mines which lie
under these singular uplifts above the great
alluvial plain. As of right, here grow mansion
homes, and here is lived life as nearly feudal
and as wholly dignified and cultured as any in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg&nbsp;385]</a></span>
any land. Ignorant of the banal word &ldquo;aristocracy,&rdquo;
here, uncounting wealth, unsearching
of self and uncritical of others, simple and fine,
folk live as the best ambition of America
might make one long to live, so far above the
vulgar northern scramble for money and display
as might make angels weep for the latter
in the comparison.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was Edouard Manning, planter,
miner, sportsman, gentleman, traveler, scholar
and host, who first taught me what wealth
might mean, may mean, ought to mean. Always,
before now, I had approached his home
with joy, as that of an old friend. There, I
knew, I would find horses, guns, dogs, good
sport and a simple welcome; and I could read
or ride as I preferred. A king among all the
cousins of Jean Lafitte, Monsieur Edouard.
Hereabouts ran the old causeway by which the
wagon reached the &ldquo;importations&rdquo; of Jean&rsquo;s
barges, brought inland from his schooners hid
in the marshes far below. Here, too, as is
well known in all the state, was the burying-ground
of Jean Lafitte&rsquo;s treasure-chests: for,
though the old adventurer sold silks and tobaccos
and sugars very cheap to the planters
and traders, he secreted, as is well known,
great store of plate, bullion and minted coins,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg&nbsp;386]</a></span>
at divers points about the several miles of forest
covered heights; so that the very atmosphere
thereabout&mdash;till custom stales it for the
visitor who comes often there&mdash;reeks with the
flavor of pieces of eight, Spanish doubloons,
and rare gems of the Orient. Laughingly,
many a time Monsieur Edouard had agreed to
go a-treasure hunting with me, even had showed
me several of the curious old treasure-keys,
maps and cabalistic characters which tell the
place where Lafitte and his men buried their
gold&mdash;such maps as are kept as secret heirlooms
in many a Cajun family.</p>

<p>But now, as I saw myself once more approaching
this pleasant spot so well known to
me, I felt little of the old thrill of eagerness
come over me. True, Edouard would be there,
and the dogs, and the birds, and the horses,
and the quiet welcome. True, also, I could,
either in truth or by evasion, establish a pleasant
and conventional footing for all my party&mdash;it
would be easy to explain so natural and
pleasant an incident as a visit during a yacht
cruise, and to laugh at all that silly newspaper
sensation which by now must fully have blown
over. True, Monsieur Edouard would be
charmed to meet the woman whose influence
on my life he knew so well. Yes, I could tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg&nbsp;387]</a></span>
him everything easily, nicely, except the truth;
which was, that I was bringing to another
man&rsquo;s arms the woman whom he knew I loved.
No, the blue loom of Manning&rsquo;s Island gave me
no joy now. I wished it three thousand miles
away instead of thirty. I wished that almost
anything might prevent my arrival&mdash;accident,
delay.</p>

<p>And then, in the most natural way in the
world, there were both! Without much warning,
the pulse of our engine slackened, the
throb of our single screw slowed down and
ceased. Williams stuck his head up out of his
engine-room and shouted something to Peterson,
who methodically drew out his pipe and
made ready for a smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use going any farther,&rdquo; explained
Williams when I came up. &ldquo;That intake&rsquo;s
gone wrong again, and she&rsquo;s got sand all
through her. It&rsquo;s a crime to see her cut herself
all to pieces this way. We&rsquo;ve just got to stop
and clean her up, that&rsquo;s all, and fix the job
right&mdash;ought to have done it back there before
we started in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will it take, Williams?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, sir. More than this afternoon,
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said I, with a fair imitation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg&nbsp;388]</a></span>
of regret. &ldquo;We had expected to make
Manning Island by night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is too bad, but it&rsquo;s better to stop
than ruin her, isn&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it is, and I quite approve your
judgment. But I presume we can go a little
way yet, until we find a good berth somewhere?
There&rsquo;s a deep channel comes in from the left,
just ahead, and I think if we move on half a
mile or so, we can get water enough to float
even at low tide, and at the same time be out
of sight of any boats passing in the lower part
of the bay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, we can get that far,&rdquo; said the
engineer. Peterson was full of gloom, and
though he thought nothing less than that we
were going to be kept here a month, as one
more event in a trip already unlucky enough,
he gave the wheel to our Cajun pilot, and we
crawled on around the head of a long point
that came out into the bay. Here we could
not see Manning Island, and were out of sight
from most of the bay, so that, once more, the
feeling of remoteness, aloofness, came upon me.</p>

<p>Not that it did me any present good. I
despatched L&rsquo;Olonnois as messenger to the
ladies, telling them the cause of our delay, and
explaining how difficult it was to say just when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg&nbsp;389]</a></span>
we would get in to the island; and then I betook
myself to gloomy pacing up and down
what restricted part of the deck I felt free for
my own use. I wearied of it soon, and went
to my cabin, trying to read.</p>

<p>At first I undertook one of the modern
novels which had been recommended by my
bookseller, but I found myself unable to get
on with it, and standing before my shelves took
down one volume after another of philosophers
who once were wont to comfort me&mdash;men with
brains, thinking men who had done something
in the world beside buying yachts and country
houses. My eye caught a page which earlier
I had turned down, and I read again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust thyself; every heart vibrates to that
iron string. Accept the place the Divine Providence
has found for you&mdash;the society of
friends, the connexion of events. Great men
have always done so, and confided themselves
childlike to the genius of their age.... And
we now are men, and must accept in the highest
mind the same transcendent destiny; and
not pinched in a corner nor cowards fleeing
before a revolution, but redeemers, and benefactors,
pious aspirants to be noble clay, under
the Almighty effort let us advance on Chaos
and the Dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg&nbsp;390]</a></span>
I read the mystic, involved, subjective words
again, as most of the Concord Sage&rsquo;s words
require, and reflected how well they jumped
with the note of my heathen Epictetus, who had
said, &ldquo;Be natural and noble&rdquo;. And, so thinking,
I began to wonder whether, after all, my
father, whose ruthless ways I betimes had explored,
whose ruthless sins I had betimes
atoned, had not been, perhaps, a better man
than sometimes I had credited him with being.
He, in accordance with his lights, had accepted
the part given him by the Poet of the Play.
He had confided himself childlike to the genius
of his age, roaring, fighting, scrambling, getting
and sometimes giving. He had trusted
himself; and in the end, a bold man, he had
advanced bravely on Chaos and the Dark.
After a life of war and sometimes of rapine,
done under the genius of his day, he had struck
boldly the last chord on an iron string. Dear
old Governor! I did not regret the million of
his money I had spent to restore his memory
clean in my own mind: for after all, it had all
been in open war&mdash;that time when he unloaded
a worthless mine on his friend, Dan Emory&mdash;Helena&rsquo;s
father, Daniel Emory, who was, at
first, said to have left his family penniless;
until a shrewd lawyer in some miraculous way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg&nbsp;391]</a></span>
had managed to sell at a good price a box full
of worthless mining stock to some innocent
victim.</p>

<p>Helena Emory never knew of that sale, nor
did her guardian aunt. I did know of it, for
the very good reason that I was both the
shrewd lawyer and the innocent purchaser. It
was the last act of my professional career;
and it was this which caused the general report
that I had made a bad mining venture,
had lost my father&rsquo;s fortune, and retired from
my career a ruined man. A few friends knew
otherwise: and I blessed the rumor which cost
me certain friends who thought me poor and
so forsook me. Perhaps, my father would have
called me quixotic had he known. Now, as
I read and pondered, I neither blamed him for
his own course in fair business war with old
Dan Emory, nor did I censure myself for my
own hidden act of restitution. Let the world
wag its head if it liked, and remain ignorant
of other millions given to me before my father&rsquo;s
death, unprobated, secret, after the fashion of
my pirate parent who buried his treasures and
told none but his kin how they might be found.</p>

<p>Of course, in time, it all might come out.
In time, Helena would know that this yacht
which she supposed to be Davidson&rsquo;s was my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg&nbsp;392]</a></span>
own, that the farm I was supposed to have
rented really was a handsome estate that I
owned, that many covert deeds in finance had
been my own&mdash;it was only my silence and my
absence in many parts of the world which had
prevented her, also much a traveler, from knowing
the truth about me long ago. And the
truth was, I was not a poor man, but a rich
one.</p>

<p>Yet he who had stolen my purse would indeed
have stolen trash this day. Rich in one
way, I was poor, indeed, in others. I cared
nothing for old Dan Emory&rsquo;s money, but very,
very much for old Dan Emory&rsquo;s daughter; and
her I might not have, even after all my efforts....
No, the waters would leave no trail; and
once more, after I had restored old Dan Emory&rsquo;s
daughter to her home and friends, I would
travel the wide world again, and the gossipers
might guess what causes had ended a professional
career, apparently ended a great fortune,
and actually had ended a life.... For, I
thought&mdash;using some philosophy of my own
making&mdash;it is not wealth, but usefulness, contentment
and independence which a man should
hold as his most desired success. These
achieved, little is left to gain. Any one of
these last, and nothing remains worth gaining.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg&nbsp;393]</a></span>
I took up another book, at another marked
page: &ldquo;Let us learn to be content with what
we have. Let us get rid of our false estimates,
set up all the higher ideals&mdash;a quiet home,
vines of our own planting; a few books full of
the inspiration of genius; a few friends worthy
of being loved; a hundred innocent pleasures
that bring no pain or remorse; a devotion to
the right that will never swerve; a simple religion
empty of all bigotry, full of trust and
hope and love&mdash;and to such a philosophy, this
world will give up all the empty joy it has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I meditated over this also, applying these
tests to my own life.... Ah! now I saw why
my foot was ever restless, why I sought always
new scenes.... Where was my quiet home,
the vines of my own planting? Would I flee
from that to every corner of the world? Not
if it held the woman of my choice. Would
she thus roam restless, if she held the heart of
her chosen and if they had a home?... I began
to see the Plan unfold. Yes, and saw myself
outside the Plan.... Because of a devotion
to the right that would not swerve. Because
of a fanaticism, an &ldquo;oddness&rdquo;, a nonconformity&mdash;ah!
so I said bitterly to myself, because,
after all, I was unattuned to my age,
because I was unfit to survive before a man&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg&nbsp;394]</a></span>
own judge.... It is Portia judges this world.
The case of every man comes before a woman
for decision. I, who rarely had lost a case at
law where I could use my own trained mind,
had lost my first and only case at the bar of
Love....</p>

<p>So&mdash;and I sighed as I shut the books and returned
them to their shelves&mdash;contentment
never could be mine, nor that quiet home
where only life is lived that is worth living;
nor usefulness; nor independence.</p>

<p>I did not hear Jimmy when he came in, and
when he spoke I jumped, startled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS AN ARMISTICE WITH FATE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;B</span>LACK BART!&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Say,
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good mate,&rdquo; said I, and laid a hand
on his curly fair head, &ldquo;what shall I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he remarked, dropping his
voice. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have held a council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who has?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, me and Jean Lafitte and the heartless
jade. I told her you sent us to her to bid
her seek your presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy! What on earth do you mean!
That&rsquo;s precisely the last thing I would have
done&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t done it. On the contrary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her,&rdquo; he resumed calmly, &ldquo;that when
Black Bart, the pirut, spoke, he spoke to be
obeyed. She said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;You
<em>gotta</em> go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, yourself, may now go and tell her
that there has been a very bad mistake, Jimmy;
and that she need not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; make her cry worse? I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg&nbsp;396]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sir! This is mutiny!&mdash;But did she cry,
Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Awful. She said she was homesick.
She ain&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know what really is the matter.
I ast Jean Lafitte, an&rsquo; he said maybe
you&rsquo;d know. We thought maybe it was something
about yon varlet. Do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not, Jimmy.&rdquo; I found myself engaged
in one of those detestable conversations
where one knows the talk ought to end, yet
dislikes to end it.</p>

<p>Jimmy stood for some time, much perturbed,
looking every way but at me, and at last he
blurted out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you just jolly well awfully love the
fair captive, yon heartless jade&mdash;my Auntie
Helen? Don&rsquo;t you, Black Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no answer, but frowned very much
at his presumption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Because, everybody else does. She&rsquo;s nice.
I should think you would. <em>I</em> do, I know mighty
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is&mdash;she is&mdash;she&rsquo;s a very estimable young
woman, Jimmy,&rdquo; said I, coloring. &ldquo;I think I
may say that without compromising myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you hurt her feelings the way
you do&mdash;when she&rsquo;s plumb gone on you, the
way she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg&nbsp;397]</a></span>
I sprang toward him to clap a hand over his
garrulous mouth, but he evaded me, and spoke
from behind the bathroom door. &ldquo;Well, she
is! Don&rsquo;t I hear her sticking up for you all
the time&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I hear her an&rsquo; Auntie Lucinda
havin&rsquo; a reg&rsquo;lar row over it again, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care
if he <em>hasn&rsquo;t</em> got a cent!&rsquo; says she.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yon varlet is rich,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t mean yon varlet&mdash;she meant you,
I&rsquo;m pretty sure, Black Bart. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s been
feedin&rsquo; Partial all the afternoon&mdash;say, he&rsquo;s the
shape of a sausage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is heartless, Jimmy! Little do you
know the ways of a heartless jade&mdash;she wants
to win away from me the last thing on earth
I have&mdash;even my dog. That&rsquo;s all. Now, Jimmy,
you must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he emerged only in part from his shelter.
&ldquo;So Jean Lafitte an&rsquo; me, we looked it up in the
book; an&rsquo; it says where the heartless jade is
brought before the pirut chief, &lsquo;How now, fair
one!&rsquo; says he, an&rsquo; he bends on her the piercin&rsquo;
gaze o&rsquo; his iggle eye: &lsquo;how now, wouldst spurn
me suit?&rsquo; The fair captive she bends her head
an&rsquo; stands before him unable to encounter his
piercin&rsquo; gaze, an&rsquo; for some moments a deep
silence prevails&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; I heard a clear voice calling along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg&nbsp;398]</a></span>
the deck. No answer, and Jimmy raised a
hand to command silence of me also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimme-e-e-e!&rdquo; It was Helena&rsquo;s voice, and
nearer along the rail. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the fudges&mdash;now
where can the little nuisance have gone! Jim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, Auntie,&rdquo; replied the little nuisance,
as she now approached the door of our
cabin; and he brushed past me and started not
aft but toward the bows. &ldquo;An&rsquo; there <em>you</em> are!&rdquo;
he shouted over his shoulder in cryptic speech,
whether to me or to his Auntie Helen I could
not say.</p>

<p>She stood now in such position near my door
that neither of us could avoid the other without
open rudeness. I looked at her gravely
and she at me, her eyes wide, her lips silent
for a time. Silently also, I swung the cabin
door wide and stood back for her to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have sent for me?&rdquo; she said at last,
still standing as she was. A faint smile&mdash;part
in humor, part in timidity, part, it seemed suddenly
to me, wistful; and all just a trifle pathetic&mdash;stirred
her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I sent my soul through the Invisible,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
I; and stepped within and quite aside for her
to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimmy told the biggest lie in all his career,&rdquo;
said I. She would have sprung back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg&nbsp;399]</a></span>
&ldquo;&mdash;And the greatest truth ever told in all
the world. Come in, Helena Emory. Come
into my quiet home. Already, as you know,
you have come into my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not used to going into a gentleman&rsquo;s&mdash;quarters,&rdquo;
said she: but her foot was on the
shallow stair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is common to three gentlemen of the
ship&rsquo;s company, Helena Emory,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
we have no better place to receive our friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She now was in the room. I closed the door,
and sprung the catch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are in my power!&rdquo;
And I bent upon her the piercing gaze of my
eagle eye.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH ARE SEALED ORDERS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>HE stood before me for just a moment undecided.
The twilight was coming and the
room was dim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie will miss me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;after a
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have missed you all the time,&rdquo; was my
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you sent for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did. Doesn&rsquo;t this look as
though I had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I call Jimmy to explain? He called
you a heartless jade&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little imp! How dare he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;As in fact all of our brotherhood has
come to call you: &lsquo;The heartless jade.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made fudges for him! And the little
wretch told me I wasn&rsquo;t playing the game!
What did he mean? Oh, Harry, I wouldn&rsquo;t
have come if I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to play the
game fairly. I&rsquo;m sorry for what I said.&rdquo; She
spoke now suddenly, impulsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg&nbsp;401]</a></span>
&ldquo;When I said&mdash;when I called you&mdash;a coward.
I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not the way you thought. I only
meant, you took an unfair advantage of a girl,
running off with her, this way, and giving her
no chance to&mdash;to get away. But now you do
give me a chance&mdash;you meant to, all along&mdash;and
in every way, as I&rsquo;ve just done telling
auntie, you&rsquo;ve been perfectly fine, perfectly
splendid, perfectly bully, too! It has been a
hard place for a man, too, but&mdash;Harry, dear
boy, I&rsquo;ll have to say it, you&rsquo;ve been some considerable
gentleman through it all! There
now!&rdquo; And she stood, aloof, agitated, very
likely flushed, though I could not tell in the
dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Helena,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as to your being any other sort of a
coward&mdash;that you had physical fear&mdash;that you
wouldn&rsquo;t do a man&rsquo;s part&mdash;why, I never did
mean that at all. How could I? And if I
had&mdash;why, even Auntie Lucinda said your going
out after that Chinaman the other night
was heroic&mdash;even if he couldn&rsquo;t have cooked
a bit!&mdash;and you know Auntie Lucinda has always
been against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you both called me a coward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg&nbsp;402]</a></span>
because I quit my law office and ran away from
misfortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did. And I meant that, too! I
say it now to your face, Harry. But maybe I
don&rsquo;t know all about that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be unjust, of
course, but I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> think a man ought to throw
away his life. You&rsquo;re young. You could start
over again, and you ought to have tried. Your
father made his own money, and so did my
father&mdash;why, look at the Sally M. mine, that
has given me my own fortune. Do you suppose
that grew on a bush to be shaken off?
So why couldn&rsquo;t you go out in the same way
and do something in the world&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean
just make money, you know, but <em>do</em> something?
That&rsquo;s what a girl likes. And you were able
enough. You are young and strong, and you
have your education; and I&rsquo;ve heard my father
say, before he died&mdash;and other men agreed
with him&mdash;that you were the best lawyer at
our bar, and that you had an extraordinary
mind, and a clear sense of justice, and, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on. Did he say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But with all my fine qualities of mind and
heart,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I lost all when I lost my
money!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg&nbsp;403]</a></span>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean&mdash;you dropped
me because you thought me poor. Well, I
don&rsquo;t blame you. It takes money to live, and
you deserved all that the world can give. I
don&rsquo;t blame you. There were other men in the
world for you. The trouble with me was that
there was no other woman in the world for
me. All our trouble&mdash;all our many meetings
and partings&mdash;have come out of those two
facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think that of me?&rdquo; she asked at
length, slowly. I suppose she was pale, but I
could not see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly did. How could I think anything
else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; she half whispered. &ldquo;Why, Harry,
Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit that you did!&rdquo; I exclaimed bitterly,
&ldquo;and let me start from that as a premise. Listen!
If you were a man, and loved a woman,
and she chucked you when you lost your
money, do you think you&rsquo;d break your neck
to make any more success in the world after
that? Why should you? Why does a man
work? It&rsquo;s for a home, for the sake of power,
and mostly for the sake of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I could play that game&mdash;I can play it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg&nbsp;404]</a></span>
now, and win at it, any time I like. I quit it
not because I was afraid of the game&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
easiest thing in the world to make money, if
that&rsquo;s all you really want to do. That&rsquo;s all
your father wanted, or mine, and it was easy.
I can play that game. But why? Ah! if it
were to win a quiet home, the woman I loved,
independence, usefulness, contentment,&mdash;yes!
But when all those stakes were out of the
game, Helena, I didn&rsquo;t care to play it any more.
And that was why you thought I ran away.
I did run away&mdash;from myself, and you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent now, and perhaps paler&mdash;I
could not see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;But wherever I have gone, Helena, all
over the world, I&rsquo;ve found those two people
there ahead of me, and I couldn&rsquo;t escape them&mdash;myself,
and you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think that of me, Harry?&rdquo; She
half whispered once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. And did you think that of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. But I did not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Like many a woman, you got cause
and effect mixed up: and you never troubled
yourself to get it straight. Let me tell you,
unless two people can come to each other without
compromises and without explanations and
without reservations, they would better never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg&nbsp;405]</a></span>
come at all. I don&rsquo;t want you cheap, you
oughtn&rsquo;t to want me cheap. So how can it
end any way other than the way it has? If
it was my loss of fortune that made you chuck
me, I oughtn&rsquo;t ever to give you a second
thought, for you wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it. The
fact you did, and that I do, hasn&rsquo;t anything to
do with it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t think me able and disposed
to play a man&rsquo;s part in the world, you
oughtn&rsquo;t to care a copper for me, that is plain,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the fact that you did, and that you do,
has nothing to do with it&mdash;nothing in the
world, has it, Helena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She must have been very pale, though
I could not tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, as logic shows us, my dear, and
because we never did get our premises straight,
and so never will get our conclusions straight,
either&mdash;we don&rsquo;t belong together and never
can come together, can we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I could barely hear her whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. And that is why, just before you came,
I was trying to pull myself together and to
advance as best an unhappy devil may, upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg&nbsp;406]</a></span>
Chaos and the Dark! And that&rsquo;s all I see
ahead, Helena, without you&mdash;Chaos and the
Dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all you saw that night, in the little
boat,&rdquo; she said after a time. &ldquo;Yet you went?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but that was different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this all, Harry?&rdquo; she said, and moved
toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; it is all&mdash;but all the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her color must have risen, for I saw dimly
that she raised both her hands to her bosom,
her throat. Thus the heartless jade stood, her
head drooped, unable to meet the piercing
gaze of my eagle eye.</p>

<p>There came a faint scratching at the door, a
little whimpering whine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Partial, my dog, come after you,&rdquo; said
I bitterly. &ldquo;He knows you are here. He never
has done that way for me. He loves you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He knows <em>you</em> are here, and he loves you,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;That is why things come and scratch
at doors where ruffians live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I flung open the door. &ldquo;Partial,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;come in; and choose between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the first part of my speech, the invitation
to enter, Partial obeyed with a rush;
as to the second, the admonition, he apparently
could not obey at all. In his poor dumb brute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg&nbsp;407]</a></span>
affliction, lack of human speech, he stood, after
saluting us both, alternately and equally, hesitant
between us, wagging, whining and gazing,
knowing full well somewhat was wrong between
us, grieving over us, beseeching us&mdash;but
certainly not choosing between us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him time,&rdquo; said I hoarsely. &ldquo;He
loves you more, and is merely polite to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him time,&rdquo; said she bitterly. &ldquo;He
loves you more, and you don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Partial would not choose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants us <em>both</em>, Helena!&rdquo; said I at last.
&ldquo;He has wiped out logic, premises, conclusions,
cause and effect, horse, cart and all!
He wants us <em>both</em>! He wants a quiet home
and independence, Helena, and usefulness, and
contentment. Ah, my God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reached down and put a hand on his
head, but he only looked from one to the other of
us, unhappy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love me, Helena?&rdquo; I asked
quietly, after a time. &ldquo;For the sake of my
dog, can you not love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She continued stroking the head of the
agonized Partial.... And until, somewhat inarticulately,
I had choked or spoken, and had
caught her dark hair against my cheek and
kissed her hair and stammered in her ear, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg&nbsp;408]</a></span>
turned her face and kissed her eyes and her
cheek and her lips many, many times, Partial
held his peace and issued no decision....
At least, I did not hear him....</p>

<p>She was sobbing now, her head on my shoulder,
as we sat on the locker seat, and Partial&rsquo;s
head was on the cushion beside us, and he was
silent and overjoyed, and tranquilly happy&mdash;seeing
perhaps, that a quiet home would in the
event be his, and that he was going to live
happy ever after. And after I drew Helena&rsquo;s
head closer to my face, I kissed her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you love me, Helena?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Only
the truth now, in God&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I do,&rdquo; she said, and I felt her
arms about my neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you, always?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, yes. It seems always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been cruel to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, are cruel now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make me say I love you, and yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will marry me&mdash;right away, soon, Helena&mdash;as
I am, poor, ragged, without a cent,
only myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Edouard Manning&rsquo;s, at once, as soon as
we get in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg&nbsp;409]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is duress! I am in the power of a ruffian
band! Is it fair? Are you sure I know
my mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure only that I know my own! Tell
me, what was in that note I carried, addressed
to yon varlet Davidson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sealed orders!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how does that affect me, Helena. Tell
me&mdash;I know you love me, and you know that
all the rest is small, to that; but as to that
wedding part of it, Helena&mdash;what do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated for an instant. &ldquo;You want me
to&mdash;come&mdash;to come with honor, as you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll take any risk that means with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take sealed orders, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn on the lights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I reached the switch, and an instant later a
dozen high candle-power bulbs flooded the suite
with light. With a little cry of dismay Helena
sprang away, and stood at my shaving-glass,
arranging her hair. Now and then she turned
her face just enough to smile at me a little, her
eyes dark, languid, heavy lidded, a faint shadow
of blue beneath. And now and then her breast
heaved, as though it were a sea late troubled
by a storm gone by.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg&nbsp;410]</a></span>
&ldquo;What will auntie say?&rdquo; she sighed at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you say?&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, brute, you shall not know! I must
have some manner of revenge against a ruffian
who has taken advantage of me while I was in
his power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, heartless jade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;So you shall wait until we are ashore. I
will give you sealed orders&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now. And you shall open them at your
friend&rsquo;s house&mdash;as soon as we are all settled and
straightened after leaving the boat&mdash;as soon
as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as though it were as soon as you
please, not when I please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harry, it is my revenge for the indignities
you have heaped on me. Do you think a girl
will submit to that meekly&mdash;to be browbeaten,
abused, endangered as I have been! No, sir&mdash;sealed
orders or none. I have only owned I
loved you. So many girls have been mistaken
about things when&mdash;when the moon, or a
desert island or&mdash;or something has bewitched
them. But I haven&rsquo;t said I would marry you,
have I, ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t care about that so much as the
other; but I care a very, very great deal about it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg&nbsp;411]</a></span>
too. You, too, are cruel. You are a heartless
jade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have been a cruel and ruthless
pirate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; And she evaded me, and gained the
door. &ldquo;I must go. Oh, it&rsquo;s all a ruin now&mdash;Auntie&rsquo;ll
be furious. And what shall I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her sealed orders, and my love! And
when do I get mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was gone.... And after some moments,
rapt as I was at her late presence, which
still seemed to fill the room like the fragrance,
like the fragrance of her hair which still lingered
in my senses, I looked about, sighing
for that she was gone. Then I noted that our
friend Partial had gone with her. &ldquo;Fie! Partial,
after all, you loved her more!&rdquo; I said to
myself.</p>

<p>But in a few moments I heard a faint sound
at my door. I opened. There stood Partial in
the dusk, gravely wagging his tail, looking at
me without moving his head. And I saw that
he held daintily in his mouth a dainty note,
addressed to me in the same handwriting as
that on the note I had sent out from the heartless
jade to yon varlet. And it was sealed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg&nbsp;412]</a></span>
marked with instructions for its opening....
&ldquo;When You Two Varlets Meet.&rdquo; No more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; said I, advancing to the forward
deck, where I found him smoking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
getting up some correspondence, since we&rsquo;ll
be ashore by to-morrow noon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know as to that, Mr. Harry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know about it. So, tell Williams
that, even if he has to work all night, we must
be moving as soon as it&rsquo;s light enough to see.
I&rsquo;ve got a very important message&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By wireless, Mr. Harry?&rdquo; chuckled the old
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, by wireless,&rdquo; (and I looked at Partial,
who wagged his tail and smiled). &ldquo;So I
must get into Manning Island the first possible
moment to-morrow. And Peterson, as we&rsquo;ve
had so good a run this trip, with no accident
or misfortune of any kind, I don&rsquo;t know but
I may make it a month or two extra pay&mdash;double&mdash;for
you and Williams, and even John.
And as to Willy, please don&rsquo;t fire him, Peterson,
for his deserting the ship&rsquo;s cook the other
night. In fact, I&rsquo;m very glad, on the whole,
he did. Give him double pay for doing it,
Peterson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this the wonderful age!&rdquo; remarked
Peterson to a star which was rising over the
misty marsh. &ldquo;Especial, now, that wireless!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg&nbsp;413]</a></span>
I only patted Partial on the head, and we
smiled pleasantly and understandingly at each
other. Of course, Peterson could not know what
we knew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH LAND SHOWS IN THE OFFING</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE the white sea mists had rolled
away I was on deck, and had summoned
a general conference of my crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Polyte,&rdquo; I demanded of our pilot, &ldquo;how
long before your partner will be at the lighthouse,
below, there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe thees day sometam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how long before he&rsquo;ll start back with
the mail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe thees same day sometam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how long will it take him to get back
to some post-office with those letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe those nex&rsquo; day sometam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then how long to the big railroad to
New Orleans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg&nbsp;415]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, maybe those nex&rsquo; day too h&rsquo;also sometam,
heem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it will be three days, four days, before
a letter could get from the lighthouse to
New Orleans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three or four days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, maybe so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how long will it take us to get in to
the plantation of Monsieur Edouard, above,
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll could not said, Monsieur. Maybe
three four day&mdash;<i>&rsquo;sais pas</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holy Mackinaw!&rdquo; I remarked, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo; remarked &rsquo;Polyte respectfully.
&ldquo;Le Machinaw&mdash;<i>que-est-que-ce-que-est, ca</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my patron saint, &rsquo;Polyte,&rdquo; I explained,
and he crossed himself for his mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose those h&rsquo;engine he&rsquo;ll h&rsquo;ron, we&rsquo;ll get
in four five h&rsquo;our h&rsquo;all right, on Monsieur Edouard,
yass,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll know those
channel lak some books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By now Williams&mdash;who, judging by certain
rappings, hammerings and clankings heard
through the cabin walls back and above the
engine-rooms, had been at work much of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg&nbsp;416]</a></span>
night&mdash;had reported, and much to my pleasure
had said he thought we could make it in at
least to the Manning dock before further repairs
would be needed. To prove which, he
went down and &ldquo;turned her over a time or
two,&rdquo; as he expressed it. Whereupon I gave
orders to break out the anchor, and knowing
that any Cajun market hunter and shrimp
fisher like &rsquo;Polyte can travel in any mist or fog
before sunup by some instinct of his own, I
took a chance and began to feel our way out
to the mouth of the Manning channel before
the morning mists were gone; so that we were
at breakfast by the time the wide and gently
rippling bay broke clear below us, and by
magic, we saw the oak-crowned heights of the
island dead ahead.</p>

<p>Thence on, within the walls of the deep
dredged channel, all we had to do was to go
sufficiently slow and follow the curves carefully,
so that the heavy waves of our boat,
larger than any intended for that channel,
might not too much endanger the mud walls,
or threaten wreckage to the frail stagings leading
to the cabins of the half-aquatic trappers
and fishers who dwell here in the marshes.</p>

<p>So, at last, after many windings and doublings,
we came in at the rear of the timbered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg&nbsp;417]</a></span>
slopes, and could see the mansion houses and
the offices of the stately old plantation, where
dwelt my friend, Edouard Manning, who knew
nothing of my coming.</p>

<p>After custom, I signaled loud and often with
the boat&rsquo;s whistle, so that the men might come
to the landing for us; and, in order that Edouard
himself might be warned, I gave orders
to my hardy mates to make proper nautical
salute of honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cast loose the stern-chaser, Jean Lafitte,&rdquo;
said I: &ldquo;and do you and L&rsquo;Olonnois load and
fire her often as you like until we land; or
until you burst her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gleefully they obeyed, and soon the roar of
our deck gun echoed formidably along the
slopes, as had no gun since the salt-seeking
Union navy, in the Civil War, had pounded at
the gates of Edouard&rsquo;s father: and until scores
of coots and rail chattered in excited chorus
for answer, and long clouds of wild ducks
arose and circled over the marsh. Again and
again, my bold mates loaded and fired: and
now, turning back by chance from my own
place at the wheel, I saw that they had assumed
full character, and each with a red kerchief
bound about his brow, was armed with,
I dare not say how many, pistols, dirks, swords
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg&nbsp;418]</a></span>
and cutlasses thrust through his belt or otherwise
suspended on his person.</p>

<p>I saw now the two ladies, their fingers in
their ears, also on deck, protesting at this
cannonading at their cabin door; and so I
raised my hat to a very radiant and radiantly
appareled Helena, for the first time that day;
and heard the answer of L&rsquo;Olonnois to the
dour protest of Auntie Lucinda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We follow Black Bart the Avenger, an&rsquo; let
any seek to stop us at their per-rul! Jean, run
up the flag, while I load her up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jean having once more hoisted the skull
and cross-bones at our masthead, and assumed
a specially savage scowl as he stood with folded
arms on our bow deck, we made what a
mild imagination might have called rather an
impressive entry as we swept into the Manning
landing.</p>

<p>I was not surprised to see Edouard himself
there, and his wife, and some thirty odd dogs
and as many blacks, waiting for us at the
wharf. Nor was I surprised to see that all
seemed somewhat to marvel at our manner of
advent, though I knew that Edouard, through
his field-glasses, had recognized both my boat
and myself long before we made the last curve
and came gently in to the wharf where the
grinning darkies could catch our line.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg&nbsp;419]</a></span>
What did surprise me&mdash;and perhaps for a
time I may have shown surprise&mdash;was to see,
in all this gay throng, two forms not usual on
the Manning landing. One was the elegantly
garbed and rather stunning figure of Sally
Byington; and the other the robust, full-bodied,
gorgeously arrayed form of my old friend, Cal
Davidson! How or why they came there I
could not for the moment guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis he&mdash;yon varlet!&rdquo; I heard a stern voice
hiss at my ear. &ldquo;Beshrew me, but it shall go
hard with him! I&rsquo;m loading her up with marbles
now!&rdquo; But I had no more than time to
persuade my two lieutenants to modify this
purpose, and partially to disarm themselves,
before the two groups were mingling, with
much chattering and laughing and gay saluting.</p>

<p>Edouard, hat in hand, was on deck before
our fenders touched the wharf, laughing and
grasping my hands and looking up at my flag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you were coming,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Fact
is, all the country&rsquo;s been looking for you.
Davidson just got in a couple of hours ago&mdash;and
you know his lady is an old friend of Mrs.
Manning&rsquo;s. And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was shaking the hands of Mrs. Daniver
and Helena almost before I could present them.
Auntie Lucinda bestowed upon him the gaze
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg&nbsp;420]</a></span>
of a solemn and somewhat tear-stained visage
(though I saw distinct approval on her face as
she caught sight of the great mansion house
among the giant oaks, and witnessed the sophisticatedness
of the group on the landing,
and the easy courtesy of Edouard himself).</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! old man!&rdquo; the latter found time
to say to me, &ldquo;I congratulate you&mdash;she&rsquo;s away
beyond her pictures.&rdquo; He did not mean Mrs.
Daniver; and he never had seen Helena before.
I could only press his hand and attempt no
comment as to the congratulations, for part of
that was a matter which yet rested in a sealed
envelope in my pocket; and at best it must be
three or four days.... But then, with a great
flash of arrested intelligence, it was borne in
upon me that perhaps, after all, it was not so
much a question of the tardy United States mails!
Because yon varlet, fat and saucy, and well content
with life, already, by some means and for
some reason, had outrun the mails. He was
here, and we had met. It need not be four
days before I could learn my fate.... I
reached into my pocket and looked at my
sealed orders. No matter what Davidson&rsquo;s letter
held, here was Davidson himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, there, you Harry, confound
you!&rdquo; roared Davidson to me in his great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg&nbsp;421]</a></span>
voice above the heads of everybody. &ldquo;I say,
what did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now I had not the slightest idea what Davidson
had told me, nor what he meant by waving
a paper over his head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve signed
Dingleheimer for next year! Now what do
you think of that? World&rsquo;s championship, and
good old Dingleheimer for next year&mdash;I guess
that&rsquo;s pretty poor for them little old Giants,
what?&rdquo; And he smiled like one devoid of all
care as well as of all reason.</p>

<p>I myself smiled just a moment later&mdash;after I
had greeted the Manning ladies, had seen
Helena step up and kiss Sally Byington fervently,
directly on the cheek, whose too keen
coloring I once had heard her decry; had
slapped Edouard joyously on the shoulders and
pointed to my pirate flag and gloomy black-visaged
crew&mdash;I say I also smiled suddenly
when I felt a hand touch me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Polyte, the pilot, stood, cap in hand, and
asked me to one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but those <i>gentilhommes</i>&mdash;those
fat one&mdash;ees eet she&rsquo;ll was Monsieur
Davelson who&rsquo;ll H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll got letter on heem
from those lighthouse, heem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, &rsquo;Polyte&mdash;the letter you said would
take four days to get to New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg&nbsp;422]</a></span>
&rsquo;Polyte smiled sheepishly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll wouldn&rsquo;t
took four days now, Monsieur! H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll got it
h&rsquo;all those letter here. H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll change the coat
on the <em>lighthouse</em>, maybe, h&rsquo;an H&rsquo;I&rsquo;ll got the coat
of Guillaume witt&rsquo; h&rsquo;all those letter in her,
yass?&rdquo; And he now handed me the entire
packet of letters, which I had supposed left far
behind us on the previous day!</p>

<p>I took the letters from him, and handed all
of them but one to Edouard&rsquo;s old body servant
to put in the office mail. The remaining
one I held in the same hand with its mate:
and I motioned Davidson aside to a spot under
a live oak as the other began now slowly to
move toward the path from the landing up
the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is for you,&rdquo; said I, handing him his
letter; and told him how it came to him thus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Helena&mdash;dear old girl, isn&rsquo;t she
a trump, after all!&rdquo; he said, tearing open the
letter and glancing at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a dear girl, Mr. Davidson,&rdquo; said I,
stiffly, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course&mdash;yes, of course I&rsquo;d have
done it, if I&rsquo;d got this before I left the city,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;but how can I now?&rdquo;&mdash;holding the
letter open in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; I began, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg&nbsp;423]</a></span>
choked in anger mixed with uncertainty. What
was it she had asked of him, offered to him?
And was not Helena&rsquo;s wish a command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean to tell you or any one else, I&rsquo;d
do a favor to a lady if I could; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What favor, Mr. Davidson?&rdquo; I demanded
icily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why &lsquo;Mr. Davidson&rsquo;? Ain&rsquo;t I your
pal, in spite of all the muss you made of my
plans? Why, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll pay you the
charter money at all, after the way you&rsquo;ve
acted, and all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Davidson, damn the charter money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say! What&rsquo;s charter money
among friends? All right, if you can forgive
half the charter fee, I&rsquo;ll forgive the other half,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was in the letter from her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business, Harry&mdash;but still,
I don&rsquo;t mind saying that Miss Emory wrote
me and said that if I was still&mdash;oh! I say!&rdquo; he
roared, turning suddenly and poking a finger
into my ribs, &ldquo;if you haven&rsquo;t got on one of my
waistcoats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one with pink stripes,&rdquo; said I still
icily, &ldquo;and deuced bad ones they all are. And
these clothes I borrowed from my China boy.
But then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg&nbsp;424]</a></span>
&ldquo;I see, you must have come in a hurry, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But come now, old man, what&rsquo;s in
that letter? I&rsquo;ve got one of my own here, done
in the same hand, hers. I am under sealed
orders&mdash;until I shall have met you, which is
now. So I suppose some sort of explanation
is due on both sides. We might as well have
it all out here, before we join the house party,
so as to avoid any awkwardness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing in my letter to amount to anything,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Miss Emory only wanted
to know if I&rsquo;d please have her trunks shipped
out here from New Orleans&mdash;only that; and
she asked me please to bring her a box of
marshmallows, as hers were all gone. She&rsquo;s
polite, always, dear old Helena&mdash;she says,
here, &lsquo;So pleasant is our journey in every way,
and so kind have you gentlemen been, and so
thoughtful in providing every luxury, that I
can not think of a single thing I could ask for
except some more marshmallows. Jimmy, the
young imp, my nephew, you know, has found
mine, though I hid them under both cushions
in the stateroom.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had my hat off, and was wiping my forehead.
A sudden burst of glory seemed to me
to envelope all the world. If there had been
duplicity anywhere, I did not care.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg&nbsp;425]</a></span>
&ldquo;I suppose Jimmy is the one with two guns
and a Jap sword, eh?&rdquo; asked Davidson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the other one, God bless him! Is that
all there was in the letter, Cal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. What&rsquo;s in yours? What&rsquo;s the game&mdash;button,
button, who&rsquo;s got the girl? And
can&rsquo;t you <em>open</em> your letter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, and did so. It contained just
two words (Helena afterward said she had not
time to write more while Auntie Lucinda might
be in from the other stateroom).<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s it say, dash you!&rdquo; demanded
Cal Davidson. &ldquo;Play fair now&mdash;I told, and so
must you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I do, Cal!&rdquo; said I, and put
it in my pocket. But I shook hands with him
most warmly, none the less....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH IS MUCH ROMANCE, AND SOME TREASURE,
ALSO VERY MUCH HAPPINESS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E walked on slowly up the hill together,
my friend Calvin Davidson and myself,
following the parti-colored group now passing
out of sight behind the shrubbery. At last we
paused and sat down on one of the many seats
that invited us. Around us, on the great lawn,
were many tropic or half-tropic plants, and the
native roses, still abloom. Yonder stood the
old bronze sun-dial that I knew so well&mdash;I
could have read the inscription, <i>I Mark Only Pleasant
Hours</i>; and I knew its penciled shadow
pointed to a high and glorious noon.... It
seemed to me that Heaven had never made
a more perfect place or a more perfect day;
nor, that I am sure, was ever in the universe
a world more beautiful than this, more fit to
swing in union with all the harmony of the
spheres.... I had fought so long, I had been
so unhappy, had doubted so much, had grown
so sad, so misanthropic, that I trust I shall be
forgiven at this sudden joy I felt at hearing
burst on my ears&mdash;albeit a chorus of Edouard&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg&nbsp;427]</a></span>
mocking-birds hid in the oaks&mdash;all the music
of the spheres, soul-shaking, a thing of joy
and reverence.... So I spoke but little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I say, old man,&rdquo; began Davidson presently,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right for a joke, but my word!
it was an awfully big one, and an awfully risky
one, too,&mdash;your stealing your own yacht from
me! I didn&rsquo;t think it of you. You not only
broke up my boat party&mdash;you see, Sally was
going on down with us from Natchez&mdash;Miss
Emory said she&rsquo;d be glad to have her come,
and of course she and Mrs. Daniver made it
proper, all right&mdash;I say, you not only busted
that all up, but by not sending a fellow the
least word of what you were going to do, you
got those silly newspapers crazy, from New
Orleans to New York&mdash;why, you&rsquo;re famous,
that is, notorious! But so is Miss Emory,
that&rsquo;s the worst of it. I don&rsquo;t just fancy she&rsquo;ll
just fancy some of those pictures, or some of
those stories. Least you can do now is to
marry Helena and the old girl, too, right off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In part, that is good advice,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
wish I could wear your clothes, Cal&mdash;but I
remember now that Edouard and I can wear
the same clothes, and have, many a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I say, don&rsquo;t be so hoggish. There&rsquo;s
other people in the world beside you&mdash;<em>you&rsquo;d</em> never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg&nbsp;428]</a></span>
have thought of making that river cruise, now
would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor you couldn&rsquo;t have got Helena aboard
the boat if you had, now could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let alone the old girl, her revered aunt!&rdquo;
He dug another thumb into his own pink
striped waistcoat. &ldquo;She loves you a lot, I am
not of the impression!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think she rather favored you!&rdquo; I replied
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chance! And I say, isn&rsquo;t Sally a humdinger?
Just the sort for me&mdash;something doing
every minute. And a fellow can always
tell just what she&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not right sure, Cal, whether that&rsquo;s safe
to say of any woman,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;A ship on the
sea, or a serpent on a rock has&mdash;to use your
own quaint manner of speech, my friend&mdash;so
to speak, nothing on the way of a maid with
a man. But go on. I do congratulate you.
Do you know, old man, I almost thought, once&mdash;a
good while ago&mdash;that you were just a
little&mdash;that is&mdash;<i>&eacute;pris</i> of Helena your own self?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come again? &lsquo;Apree&rsquo;&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Gone on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all, not at all&mdash;not in the least!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg&nbsp;429]</a></span>
Why, I can&rsquo;t see what in the world&mdash;oh, well
of course, you know, she&rsquo;s <em>fine</em>; but what I
mean is, why&mdash;there was Sally, you know.
Say, do you know why I wanted to get Sally
away on that boat?&mdash;I was afraid you&rsquo;d cut in
somewhere, run across her down at Mardi Gras,
or something. And I just <em>figured</em>, once you
got a girl on a boat that way, away from all
the other fellows, you know, why even a plain
chap like me would have a chance, do you see?
And I say now, I&rsquo;ll own it up&mdash;I was right
down <em>jealous</em> of <em>you</em>, too! Wasn&rsquo;t it silly? And
I ask your pardon. You&rsquo;re an awfully good
sort, Harry, though you&rsquo;re so d&mdash;&mdash;d serious&mdash;you
get too much in earnest, take things too
hard, you know. Will you shake hands with
me, knowing what a fool I&rsquo;ve been? I say,
you&rsquo;re the best chap in the world, old man&mdash;if
only you were a little more <em>human</em> once in a
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put out his hand and I met it. &ldquo;Will
you shake hands with me, Cal?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;on
precisely those same terms about having been
an awful fool? It&rsquo;s you who are the best chap
in the world. And I&rsquo;ll admit it&mdash;I was jealous
of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He roared at this. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as
George Cohan says, &lsquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well&rsquo;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg&nbsp;430]</a></span>
and I guess we couldn&rsquo;t beat this for a championship
year, now could we? Now say, about
Dingleheimer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang Dingleheimer, Cal!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;What I want to know is, did you ever talk
any to Miss Emory about&mdash;well, about me, you
know?&mdash;say anything about my affairs, or anything,
you know? I mean while you were
there on the boat together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She wouldn&rsquo;t let me. Besides, the
truth is, I was so full of Sally all the time, I
mostly talked about <em>her</em>. By Jove! that was a
measly trick you played us, running off with
the boat from under my nose! But I proposed
to Sally in Natchez that night, and she came
on down to the city the next day by rail&mdash;while
<em>I</em> ran down in that dirty little scow you left
behind. And I never tumbled for days that it
was <em>you</em> had run off with the boat&mdash;though I
found a photo of Helena and your cigarette
case in the boat you left. Never tumbled till
that story of the taxi driver came out. Then
I said, &lsquo;Well, of all things! Wonder if that
old stick has really come to life after all!&rsquo;
And you sure had! What&rsquo;s in <em>your</em> letter?
Say, ain&rsquo;t a boat the place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you happen to be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve known Ed Manning years, in New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg&nbsp;431]</a></span>
York, Paris, all around. He asked me to visit
him some time. I wired and asked him if I
could come out for our honeymoon&mdash;you know,
Harry, I&rsquo;m such a d&mdash;&mdash;d romantic son of a
gun, and once before I was out here at Ed&rsquo;s,
and those d&mdash;&mdash;d nightingales, catbirds, what
d&rsquo;ye call &rsquo;ems&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Mockers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mockers, they sung so sweet, especial
in the evenings, you know&mdash;and I&rsquo;m so d&mdash;&mdash;d
romantic&mdash;<em>always</em> was thataway&mdash;and you
know, why, a fellow <em>can</em> be romantic on his
honeymoon, can&rsquo;t he?&mdash;he can just cut loose
then an&rsquo; be as big a d&mdash;n fool as he likes
then&mdash;an&rsquo; get away with it, what? Say, can&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;But&mdash;honeymoon? Are you going to be
married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Naw! I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be married&mdash;I <em>am</em>
married! Day before yesterday, in New Orleans.
And I don&rsquo;t believe in dandlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; foolin&rsquo;
around about a little thing like that. Ain&rsquo;t
you married yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Impossible. No preacher on C&ocirc;te
Blanche Bay or on our boat. I&rsquo;ve got Aunt
Lucinda Daniver along, to take care of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg&nbsp;432]</a></span>
proprieties. If I should leave it to her, I never
would be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thinks I&rsquo;m broke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, too bad about that! I wish I could
swap bank rolls with you. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
her the truth&mdash;and Helena, too? Why didn&rsquo;t
you tell &rsquo;em it was your own yacht? Why
didn&rsquo;t you tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;re worth a few millions
and don&rsquo;t have to work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;m like you, Cal,
foolish about nightingales and things. But tell
me&mdash;you never did tell them anything about
that Sally M. mine business, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I should say not! Didn&rsquo;t you tell me
you didn&rsquo;t want it to get out? It was bad
enough, the way old Dan and your&mdash;sainted
father handed it to each other over that mine,
wasn&rsquo;t it? I know about it, for I promoted
that mine myself, and the name&rsquo;ll prove that&mdash;Sally
M. Byington, with the Byington left off!
There wasn&rsquo;t a blasted thing in it then. But
when you&mdash;like a blame quixotic fool&mdash;after
she was good for six thousand a month velvet,
and ore blocked out to last a thousand years&mdash;why,
then you fool around in Papa&rsquo;s records,
and think Papa wasn&rsquo;t on the square with old
Dan. So on the quiet you get it all made over,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg&nbsp;433]</a></span>
back to old Dan&rsquo;s daughter; and take a sneak
into the hazelbrush when she turns you down!
Say, you know what <em>I&rsquo;d</em> a-done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a-held on to the mine and told the girl
how much it was bringin&rsquo; in&mdash;that&rsquo;s <em>my</em> system.
Then I&rsquo;d a-got the mine and the girl
both, maybe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the system I&rsquo;d a-played. I
wouldn&rsquo;t a-took to the tall grass, me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, I played a system invented
by myself and Henri L&rsquo;Olonnois.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of him. Well, anyhow, you
were rich enough to afford to do what you
liked. But as to keeping it secret, you can&rsquo;t
do that any longer. Those newspaper fellows
are the devil to get hold of things. Since all
this stuff came out about you running away
with your own boat&mdash;I can see now why you
did it, and I&rsquo;m glad you did&mdash;why, your whole
life history has been printed, including all that
restitution business about the Sally M. Fellows
came to me and asked me about you,
asked if I knew you. Said, yes, I knew you&mdash;said
you were a romantic chap, and a good
business man, too&mdash;and the best old scout in
the world&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg&nbsp;434]</a></span>
I had arisen, and stood in some doubt.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;let&rsquo;s go on up to the
house. I want to see Sally,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I want very much to see Helena,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;Only, it&rsquo;s going to be rather harder
now to meet her&mdash;and Mrs. Daniver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Cal Davidson;
&ldquo;every fellow plays his own system. There&rsquo;s
something in what you say about women having
a good poker face so far as tellin&rsquo; what they
think about a man is concerned&mdash;yes. Frinstance,
how much did Helena know I knew, or
know you knew or thought you knew&mdash;well,
you get me? But the trouble with you is,
you ain&rsquo;t romantic in your temperament like
me.... But if I was you, I wouldn&rsquo;t be scared
to tell Mrs. Daniver I had a dollar and a quarter
or so left! It&rsquo;ll soften the blow some to
her, maybe. And as for Helena&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as for Helena, I can look her in the
face, and she can me, now. And&mdash;will you
telephone to New Iberia for a minister&mdash;at
once&mdash;for this evening train? And will you
tell Edouard to have his man lay out his best
evening clothes for me&mdash;tell him I&rsquo;ll trade him
these of my cook&rsquo;s for them&mdash;and a suit of
traveling clothes? Because, oh! fellow varlet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
(I paused here; we both did; for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg&nbsp;435]</a></span>
mocker just now broke into an extraordinary
burst of song, so sweet, so throbbingly sweet,
that we could not help but listen, both of us
being lovers)....</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you saying, old man?&rdquo; Cal Davidson
asked after a while, musingly, as one
awakening.... &ldquo;Some bird, what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>... &ldquo;Because, to-night,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I am
going to marry my fair captive, yon heartless
jade, Helena. I&rsquo;ve loved her always, rich or
poor, and she loves me, rich or poor. And we
shall live happy ever after. And may God bless
us, and all true lovers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; I heard some one say; and have
often wondered whether it was yon varlet, the
mocking-bird, or Cal Davidson himself, who
spoke.... I looked around for Partial. He
had followed Helena.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> (The words in Helena&rsquo;s note, addressed to Henry
Francis Drake, Esquire, were, as I have said, but two:
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Now&rdquo;. That was why I was married that evening.
It was curious about the wedding ring, for that I would
not borrow; so an old negro blacksmith took a gold ring
Edouard gave me, one found years ago by a Cajun
treasure hunter in some one of the few successful hunts
for the treasure of Jean Lafitte; and into this, in place of
the gem long since missing, he clasped my pearl, the one
we got on the river far in the north; the great pearl later
known as the largest and most brilliant ever found in
fresh water. It was I who named it the &ldquo;<i>Belle Hel&egrave;ne</i>&rdquo;.
So that our ring pleased all but L&rsquo;Olonnois and Jean Lafitte.
These two pirates had set at work that very afternoon,
with &rsquo;Polyte (by Edouard&rsquo;s consent) and dug behind
the smoke-house. Wonderful enough, they did find
old bricks, enclosing a sort of hollow cavity, bricks of an
ancient day; and though they got nothing else (&rsquo;Polyte
said he knew who had beaten them to this treasure&mdash;it
was Achilles Dufrayne of Calcasieu, curse him!) they
both explained how easy it would be to deceive the fair
captive into thinking we really had found the ring&rsquo;s setting
as well as the ring itself, in a pirate treasure-box.
I would not do that, on the ground that already I had
deceived the fair captive quite enough.... But, though
yon varlet, my friend dear old Cal Davidson, spoke rather
freely about his honeymoon, and all that, I can not do so
of mine with Helena.... I did not know that I could
again be so happy. Often I have wished I were a romantic
man, like dear old Cal.... I fear my book on
the mosquitoes of North America never will be written
now.&mdash;H. F. D.)</p></div>
